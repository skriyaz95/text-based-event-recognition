176	I think Phoebe thinks I m foxy
177	It s not possible

184	I m sorry  I just think
185	you misunderstood her
186	No  I didn t misunderstand  okay

203	I don t think I have enough quarters
204	PHOEBE
205	Oh  I have quarters
206	Hey
207	Hey  Ross  any word on the apartment yet
208	Well  I called over there  and it turns out
209	Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself
210	And he s already had like 100 applicants
211	ALL  Oh
212	No  no  I ve got the edge
213	I know it s not exactly ethical
214	but I sent him a bribe
215	to tip the scales in my direction
216	Yeah  Check it out
217	you can see it from the window
218	Oh  is it that pinball machine
219	with the big bow on it
220	No
221	That new mountain bike
222	No
223	Well  what did you send
224	A basket of mini muffins
225	There s a whole table
226	of mini muffin baskets
227	Which one did you send
228	The small one
229	What  You actually thought that basket
230	was gonna get you the apartment
231	Well  yeah
232	Someone sent us a basket at work once
233	and people went crazy over those muffins
234	It was the best day
235	Your work makes me sad
236	Oh  man  I want that place so much
237	And I was so sure
238	that was going to work
239	There s 12 bucks
240	I ll never see again
241	All right  we d better go
242	if we re gonna catch that movie
243	Bye
244	Bye
245	Bye  Chandler  I miss you already
246	Okay  did you see that
247	With the inappropriate  and the pinching
248	Actually  I did
249	So now do you believe
250	that she s attracted to me
251	Oh  my God  Oh  my God
252	She knows about us
253	Are you serious
254	Phoebe knows
255	and she s just trying to freak us out
256	That s the only explanation for it
257	Okay  but what about my pinchable butt
258	and my bulging biceps
259	She knows
260	Joey
261	Yeah
262	Phoebe knows about us
263	Well  I didn t tell them
264	Them  Who s  them
265	Uh  Phoebe and Joey
266	Joey
267	And Rachel
268	Look  I would have told you
269	but they made me promise not to tell
270	Oh  man
271	I m sorry
272	But  hey  it s over now  right
273	Because you can tell them
274	you know they know
275	and I can go back to knowing
276	absolutely nothing
277	Unless
278	No  not  unless   This must end now
279	Oh  man  they think they are so slick
280	messing with us
281	But they don t know
282	that we know that they know
283	So
284	Ah  yes
285	The messers become the messees
286	WHINES
287	Oh  Ross  honey
288	you gotta stop torturing yourself
289	Why don t you just find
290	another apartment
291	I ve already looked at
292	like a thousand apartments this month
293	None of them even compares
294	to that one
295	You know what you should do
296	You should find out what his hobbies are
297	and then use that to bond with him
298	Yeah  Like if I wanted something
299	from Joey
300	I would strike up a conversation
301	about  say  um  sandwiches
302	or  uh  my underwear
303	I m listening
304	See
305	That is a great idea
306	And I know Ugly Naked Guy because
307	we ve been watching him for five years
308	So that gives me back my edge  Ha  ha
309	Let s see now  He had the trampoline
310	But he broke that
311	Well  he had gravity boots
312	Yeah  he broke those too
313	So he likes to break stuff
314	Okay  I ve got to go pick up Ben
315	but I will figure something out
316	Hey  didn t he used to have a cat
317	I wouldn t bring that up
318	It would probably just bum him out
319	Poor cat never saw that big butt coming
320	PHONE RINGS
