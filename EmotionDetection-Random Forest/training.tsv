120	4	All right you have my attention Rose
121	0	Can you tell us who the woman in the picture is
122	4	Oh yes  The woman in the picture is me
123	4	She s a goddamn liar  Some nutcase seeking money or publicity
124	4	God only knows why  Like that Russian babe Anesthesia
125	4	They re inbound
126	0	Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic when she was 17 right
127	0	That s right
128	0	If she had lived she d be over 100 by now
129	0	101 next month
130	2	Okay so she s a very old goddamn liar
131	0	Look I ve already done the background on this woman
132	0	all the way back to the  20s when she was working as an actress
133	0	An actress  There s your first clue Sherlock
134	0	Her name was Rose Dawson back then  Then she marries this guy named Calvert
135	0	They move to Cedar Rapids and she punches out a couple of kids
136	0	Now Calvert s dead and from what I hear Cedar Rapids is dead
137	0	And everybody who knows about the diamond
138	0	is supposed to be dead or on this boat but she knows
139	0	Doesn t exactly travel light does she
140	0	Hurry up give him a hand
141	0	Mrs  Calvert I m Brock Lovett  Welcome to the Keldysh
142	0	Okay let s get her inside there

144	4	Welcome to the Keldysh Thanks
145	0	Yes
146	0	Are your staterooms all right Oh yes very nice
147	4	Have you met my granddaughter Lizzy  She takes care of me
148	0	We met just a few minutes ago  Remember Nana up on deck
149	0	Oh yeah
150	0	There  That s nice  Have to have my pictures when I travel
151	0	Can I get you anything  Is there anything you d like
152	0	Yes
153	0	I would like to see my drawing
154	0	Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone called the Blue Diamond of the Crown
155	0	It disappeared in 1792
156	0	About the same time old Louis lost everything from the neck up
157	0	The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too
158	0	Recut into a heartlike shape that became known as the  Heart of the Ocean
159	0	Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond
160	0	It was a dreadful heavy thing  I only wore it this once
161	0	You actually think this is you Nana
162	0	It is me dear
163	4	Wasn t I a dish
164	0	I tracked it down through insurance records
165	0	An old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy
166	0	Can you tell me who the claimant was Rose
167	0	I should imagine someone named Hockley
168	0	Nathan Hockley  That s right  Pittsburgh steel tycoon
169	0	The claim was for a diamond necklace his son Caledon bought his fiance you
170	0	A week before he sailed on Titanic
171	0	It was filed right after the sinking
172	0	So the diamond had to have gone down with the ship
173	0	You see the date
174	0	April 14 1912
175	0	Which means if your grandmother is who she says she is
176	0	she was wearing the diamond the day the Titanic sank
177	4	And that makes you my new best friend
178	0	These are some of the things we recovered from your stateroom
179	4	This was mine
180	0	How extraordinary
181	4	And it looks the same as it did the last time I saw it
182	0	The reflection has changed a bit
183	0	Are you ready to go back to Titanic
184	0	Here we go  She hits the  berg on the starboard side
185	0	She kind of bumps along punching holes like Morse code along the side
186	0	below the water line
187	0	Then the forward compartments start to flood
188	0	Now as the water level rises it spills over the watertight bulkheads
189	0	which unfortunately don  t go any higher than  E  deck
190	0	So now as the bow goes down the stern rises up slow at first
191	0	then faster and faster until finally she s got her whole ass sticking in the air
192	0	And that s a big ass  We re talking 20  000 30  000 tons
193	0	Okay  And the hull s not designed to deal with that pressure
194	0	So what happens  She splits right down to the keel
195	0	and the stern falls back level
196	0	Then as the bow sinks it pulls the stern vertical and then finally detaches
197	0	Now the stern section kind of bobs there like a cork for a couple of minutes
198	0	floods and finally goes under about 2 20 am
199	0	2 hours and 40 minutes after the collision
200	0	The bow section planes away landing about a a mile away
201	0	going 20 30 knots when it hits the ocean floor
202	0	Pretty cool huh
203	0	Thank you for that fine forensic analysis Mr  Bodine
204	0	Of course the experience of it was
205	0	somewhat different
206	0	Will you share it with us
207	0	I m taking her to rest No
208	0	Come on Nana No
209	0	Give me the tape recorder
210	0	Tell us Rose
211	0	It s been 84 years
212	0	It s okay  Just try to remember anything anything at all
213	0	Do you want to hear this or not Mr  Lovett
214	0	It s been 84 years
215	4	and I can still smell the fresh paint
216	4	The china had never been used
217	4	The sheets had never been slept in
218	4	Titanic was called  The Ship of Dreams
219	4	And it was

225	0	I don t see what all the fuss is about

227	4	You can be blas  about some things Rose but not about Titanic
228	4	It s over 100 feet longer than Mauretania and far more luxurious
229	0	Your daughter is far too difficult to impress Ruth
230	0	So this is the ship they say is unsinkable
231	0	It is unsinkable  God himself could not sink this ship
232	0	Sir you have to check your baggage through the main terminal

340	4	I m the king of the world
341	4	She s the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in all history
342	4	And our master shipbuilder Mr  Andrews here designed her from the keel plates up
343	4	I may have knocked her together but the idea was Mr  Ismay s
344	4	He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale
345	4	and so luxurious in its appointments that its supremacy would never be challenged
346	4	And here she is willed into solid reality
347	4	Hear hear
348	0	The salmon

360	0	Do you know of Dr  Freud Mr  Ismay

497	0	and you still had time to remove your jacket and your shoes
498	0	I know you ve been melancholy
499	0	I don t pretend to know why
500	1	I intended to save this
501	1	until the engagement gala next week
502	0	But I thought tonight
503	0	Good gracious

505	0	Is it a Diamond  Yes

507	0	It was worn by Louis XVI
508	4	And they called it  Le Coeur de la Mer

514	4	There is nothing I d deny you
515	4	if you would not deny me
516	1	Open your heart to me Rose
517	1	I ve been on my own since I was 15
518	1	Since my folks died
519	1	And I had no brothers or sisters or close kin in that part of the country
520	1	So I lit on out of there and I haven t been back since
521	1	You can just call me a tumbleweed blowing in the wind
522	1	Well Rose we ve walked about a mile around this boat deck
523	1	chewed over how great the weather s been and how I grew up
524	1	but I reckon that s not why you came to talk to me is it
525	1	Mr  Dawson I Jack

531	0	I know what you must be thinking
532	1	Poor little rich girl  What does she know about misery
533	0	No
534	0	That s not what I was thinking
535	0	What I was thinking was
536	1	what could have happened to this girl to make her think she had no way out
537	0	Well I
538	1	It was everything
539	1	It was my whole world and all the people in it
540	1	And the inertia of my life
541	1	plunging ahead and me powerless to stop it
542	1	God look at that thing
543	1	You d have gone straight to the bottom
544	0	500 invitations have gone out
545	0	All of Philadelphia society will be there
546	0	And all the while I feel I m
547	1	standing in the middle of a crowded room
548	1	screaming at the top of my lungs and no one even looks up
549	0	Do you love him
550	0	Pardon me
551	0	Do you love him
552	0	You re being very rude  You shouldn t be asking me this
553	0	It s a simple question  Do you love the guy or not
554	0	This is not a suitable conversation
555	0	Why can t you just answer the question
556	0	This is absurd
557	0	You don t know me and I don t know you
558	0	and we are not having this conversation at all
559	0	You are rude and uncouth and presumptuous and
560	0	I am leaving now

579	1	Well a person of limited means
580	0	Go on a poor guy  You can say it
581	0	Well well well
582	0	And these were drawn from life
583	4	That s one of the good things about Paris
584	4	Lots of girls willing to take their clothes off
585	0	You liked this woman
586	0	You used her several times
587	0	Well she had beautiful hands you see
588	0	I think you must have had a love affair with her
589	0	No no no no  just with her hands
590	1	She was a onelegged prostitute
591	1	See
592	4	She had a good sense of humor though
593	1	And this lady
594	1	she used to sit at this bar every night
595	1	wearing every piece of jewelry she owned just
596	1	waiting for her long lost love
597	1	We called her Madame Bijoux
598	1	See her clothes are all motheaten
599	1	Well you have a gift Jack
600	1	You do
601	1	You see people I see you
602	1	And

622	0	Of course I m just a passenger
623	0	I leave it to your good offices to decide what s best
624	2	But what a glorious end to your final crossing

919	0	About half actually
920	0	Rose you miss nothing do you
921	0	In fact I put in these newtype davits
922	0	which can take an extra row of boats inside this one
923	0	But it was thought by some
924	0	the deck would look too cluttered
925	0	So I was overruled
926	0	It s a waste of deck space as it is in an unsinkable ship
927	4	Sleep soundly young Rose
928	4	I have built you a good ship strong and true
929	4	She s all the lifeboat you need
930	4	Keep heading aft  The next stop will be the engine room
