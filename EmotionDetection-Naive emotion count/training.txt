13 meters. You should see it.:->emotionless
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.:->emotionless
Okay, Mir2, we're going over the bow. Stay with us.:->emotionless
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.:->emotionless
Seeing her coming out of the darkness like a ghost ship ...:->emotionless
still gets me every time.:->emotionless
To see the sad ruin of the great ship, sitting here ...:->sad
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning of April 15, 1912 ...:->sad
after her long fall ...:->sad
from the world above.:->sad
You're so full of shit, boss.:->happy
Dive 6.:->emotionless
Here we are again on the deck of Titanic.:->emotionless
2½ miles down.:->emotionless
3,821 meters.:->emotionless
The pressure outside is 3½ tons per square inch.:->emotionless
These windows are 9 inches thick and if they go ...:->emotionless
it's sayonara in 2 microseconds.:->sad
All right, enough of that bullshit.:->sad
Just put her down on the roof of the officers' quarters like yesterday.:->emotionless
Sure.:->emotionless
Okay, Mir2, we're landing right over the Grand Staircase.:->emotionless
You guys set to launch?:->emotionless
Yeah, Brock, launching Dunkin now. Go, Charlie.:->emotionless
All right, tether out.  Tether out.:->emotionless
Okay, Brock, we're dropping down along the hull.:->emotionless
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down, and go into the firstclass gangway door.:->emotionless
I want you guys working the "D" deck reception area and the dining saloon.:->emotionless
Copy that.:->emotionless
Tether out.  Tether out.:->emotionless
Okay, now left. Now left. Left, left.:->emotionless
Snoop Dog is on the move. We're headed down the stairwell.:->emotionless
Okay, Lewis, drop down to "B" deck.:->emotionless
"A" deck.:->emotionless
Give me some rope, Captain.  "B" deck. Get in there.:->emotionless
Watch the door frame. Watch it.  I see it. I got it.:->emotionless
We're good. Just chill, boss.:->emotionless
Okay, make your turn.:->emotionless
Cable out, Captain.  Make your turn. Watch the wall.:->emotionless
Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?:->emotionless
Copy that.:->emotionless
Right there.:->emotionless
That's it. That's the bedroom door.  I see it.:->Emotionless
We're in. We're in, baby. We're there.:->happy
That's Hockley's bed. That's where the son of a bitch slept.:->happy
Oops. Somebody left the water running.:->happy
Hold it. Just a second. Go back to the right.:->emotionless
That wardrobe door. Get closer.:->emotionless
You're smelling something, boss.  I want to see what's under it.:->emotionless
Give me my hands, man.:->emotionless
All right.:->emotionless
Take it easy. It might come apart.  Okay.:->emotionless
Okay, go. Flip it over. Go. Turn over.:->emotionless
Keep going. Go.:->emotionless
Okay, drop it.:->emotionless
Oh, baby. Are you seeing this, boss?:->emotionless
It's payday, boys.:->happy
Chaching!:->happy
We did it, Bobby.  We brought it back.:->happy
Oh, yeah! You the man!:->happy
Who's the best, baby? Say it.:->happy
You are, Lewis.:->happy
Bobby, my cigar.  Right here.:->happy
Okay, crack her open.:->Emotionless
Let me get around. Hang on.:->Emotionless
You getting it?  Got it.:->emotionless
Shit.:->Emotionless
No diamond.:->anger
You know, boss, this same thing happened to Geraldo ...:->anger
and his career never recovered.:->anger
Turn the camera off.:->anger
Brock. The partners would like to know how it's going.:->emotionless
Hey, Dave. Barry, hi. Look, it wasn't in the safe.:->happy
Don't worry about it. There are still plenty of places it could be.:->emotionless
Hell, yes.:->emotionless
The floor debris in the suite, the mother's room ...:->emotionless
The purser's safe on "C" deck.  Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.:->emotionless
A dozen other places.:->emotionless
Guys, look, you just got to trust my instincts. I know we're close.:->happy
We just got to go through a little process of elimination.:->anger
Hang on a second.:->emotionless
Let me see that.  We might have something here, guys.:->Emotionless
Where's the photograph of the necklace?  We'll call you right back.:->Emotionless
I'll be goddamned.:->Emotionless
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett is best known for finding Spanish gold.:->emotionless
It's okay, I'll feed you in a minute.:->emotionless
He has chartered Russian subs to reach the most famous shipwreck of all ...:->emotionless
the Titanic.:->emotionless
He's with us live via satellite, from the research ship Keldysh ...:->emotionless
in the North Atlantic.:->emotionless
Hello, Brock.  Hello, Tracy.:->emotionless
Of course, everyone knows the familiar stories of Titanic.:->happy
You know, the nobility of the band playing to the very end and all that.:->happy
But what I'm interested in are the untold stories ...:->happy
the secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.:->happy
And we're out here using robot technology to go further into the wreck ...:->emotionless
than anybody has ever done before.:->happy
Your expedition is at the center of a storm ...:->Emotionless
of controversy over salvage rights, and even ethics.:->Emotionless
Many are calling you a graverobber.:->Emotionless
Nobody ever called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb ...:->Emotionless
What is it?  Turn that up, dear.:->emotionless
I have museumtrained experts sent out here making sure ...:->emotionless
that these relics are preserved and catalogued properly.:->emotionless
Take a look at this drawing that we found just today.:->Emotionless
A piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years ...:->Emotionless
and my team are able to preserve it intact.:->Emotionless
Should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity?:->happy
We can see it and ...:->emotionless
I'll be goddamned.:->Emotionless
Brock, there's a satellite call for you.:->emotionless
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles going in the water?:->emotionless
Trust me, buddy, you want to take this call.:->emotionless
This better be good.:->emotionless
You got to speak up. She's kind of old.  Great.:->emotionless
This is Brock Lovett. How can I help you, Mrs. ...:->emotionless
Calvert. Rose Calvert.:->emotionless
Mrs. Calvert?:->Emotionless
I was just wondering if you had found the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.:->Emotionless
Told you you wanted to take the call.:->happy
All right, you have my attention, Rose.:->happy
Can you tell us who the woman in the picture is?:->Emotionless
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.:->happy
She's a goddamn liar! Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.:->happy
God only knows why! Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.:->happy
They're inbound!:->happy
Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic when she was 17, right?:->Emotionless
That's right.:->emotionless
If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.:->Emotionless
101 next month.:->emotionless
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.:->anger
Look, I've already done the background on this woman ...:->Emotionless
all the way back to the '20s, when she was working as an actress.:->emotionless
An actress. There's your first clue, Sherlock.:->Emotionless
Her name was Rose Dawson back then. Then she marries this guy named Calvert.:->emotionless
They move to Cedar Rapids and she punches out a couple of kids.:->emotionless
Now Calvert's dead, and from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.:->emotionless
And everybody who knows about the diamond ...:->emotionless
is supposed to be dead or on this boat, but she knows.:->emotionless
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?:->Emotionless
Hurry up, give him a hand!:->emotionless
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett. Welcome to the Keldysh.:->emotionless
Okay, let's get her inside there.:->emotionless
Hi, Miss Calvert.  Hi.:->emotionless
Welcome to the Keldysh.  Thanks.:->happy
Yes?:->emotionless
Are your staterooms all right?  Oh, yes, very nice.:->emotionless
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.:->happy
We met just a few minutes ago. Remember, Nana, up on deck?:->emotionless
Oh, yeah ...:->Emotionless
There. That's nice. Have to have my pictures when I travel.:->emotionless
Can I get you anything? Is there anything you'd like?:->emotionless
Yes.:->emotionless
I would like to see my drawing.:->emotionless
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone called the Blue Diamond of the Crown.:->emotionless
It disappeared in 1792.:->emotionless
About the same time old Louis lost everything from the neck up.:->emotionless
The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped, too.:->fear
Recut into a heartlike shape that became known as the "Heart of the Ocean".:->emotionless
Today, it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.:->emotionless
It was a dreadful, heavy thing. I only wore it this once.:->Emotionless
You actually think this is you, Nana?:->Emotionless
It is me, dear.:->Emotionless
Wasn't I a dish?:->happy
I tracked it down through insurance records.:->emotionless
An old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy.:->emotionless
Can you tell me who the claimant was, Rose?:->emotionless
I should imagine someone named Hockley.:->emotionless
Nathan Hockley. That's right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon.:->emotionless
The claim was for a diamond necklace his son, Caledon, bought his fiancée, you.:->emotionless
A week before he sailed on Titanic.:->emotionless
It was filed right after the sinking.:->emotionless
So the diamond had to have gone down with the ship.:->emotionless
You see the date?:->emotionless
April 14, 1912.:->emotionless
Which means if your grandmother is who she says she is ...:->Emotionless
she was wearing the diamond the day the Titanic sank.:->Emotionless
And that makes you my new best friend.:->happy
These are some of the things we recovered from your stateroom.:->emotionless
This was mine.:->happy
How extraordinary!:->Emotionless
And it looks the same as it did the last time I saw it.:->happy
The reflection has changed a bit.:->emotionless
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?:->emotionless
Here we go. She hits the 'berg on the starboard side.:->emotionless
She kind of bumps along, punching holes like Morse code along the side ...:->emotionless
below the water line.:->emotionless
Then the forward compartments start to flood.:->emotionless
Now, as the water level rises, it spills over the watertight bulkheads ...:->emotionless
which, unfortunately, don't go any higher than "E" deck.:->emotionless
So now, as the bow goes down, the stern rises up, slow at first ...:->emotionless
then faster and faster, until finally, she's got her whole ass sticking in the air.:->emotionless
And that's a big ass. We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons.:->emotionless
Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal with that pressure.:->emotionless
So what happens? She splits, right down to the keel ...:->emotionless
and the stern falls back level.:->emotionless
Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the stern vertical and then finally detaches.:->emotionless
Now the stern section kind of bobs there like a cork for a couple of minutes ...:->emotionless
floods, and finally goes under about 2:20 am ...:->emotionless
2 hours and 40 minutes after the collision.:->emotionless
The bow section planes away, landing about a ½ a mile away ...:->emotionless
going 20, 30 knots when it hits the ocean floor.:->emotionless
Pretty cool, huh?:->emotionless
Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.:->Emotionless
Of course, the experience of it was:->Emotionless
somewhat different.:->Emotionless
Will you share it with us?:->emotionless
I'm taking her to rest.  No.:->emotionless
Come on, Nana.  No!:->emotionless
Give me the tape recorder.:->Emotionless
Tell us, Rose.:->Emotionless
It's been 84 years.:->emotionless
It's okay. Just try to remember anything, anything at all.:->emotionless
Do you want to hear this or not, Mr. Lovett?:->emotionless
It's been 84 years ...:->emotionless
and I can still smell the fresh paint.:->happy
The china had never been used.:->happy
The sheets had never been slept in.:->happy
Titanic was called "The Ship of Dreams".:->happy
And it was.:->happy
It really was.:->happy
All thirdclass passengers with a forward berth ...:->happy
this way, please! This queue! Right here ...:->happy
It's a big boat, huh?  Daddy, it's a ship.:->happy
You're right.:->happy
I don't see what all the fuss is about.:->Emotionless
It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania.:->anger
You can be blasé about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic.:->happy
It's over 100 feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious.:->happy
Your daughter is far too difficult to impress, Ruth.:->Emotionless
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.:->emotionless
It is unsinkable. God himself could not sink this ship.:->emotionless
Sir, you have to check your baggage through the main terminal.:->emotionless
It's round that way, sir.:->emotionless
I put my faith in you, good sir. Now, kindly see my man.:->emotionless
Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir. If I can do anything at all ...:->emotionless
Yes, right.:->emotionless
All the trunks from that car there. 12 from here.:->emotionless
And the safe, to the parlor suite, rooms B52, 54, 56.:->emotionless
Ladies, we better hurry. Come along.:->emotionless
My coat?  I have it, miss.:->emotionless
Queue here for health inspection.:->emotionless
All thirdclass passengers queue here for health inspection.:->emotionless
Chin up.:->emotionless
Welcome aboard, ma'am.  Welcome to Titanic.:->emotionless
It was the ship of dreams to everyone else.:->emotionless
To me, it was a slave ship ...:->Emotionless
taking me back to America in chains.:->Emotionless
Outwardly, I was everything a well brought up girl should be.:->emotionless
Inside, I was screaming.:->Emotionless
Jack, you are pazzo. You bet everything we have.:->Emotionless
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.:->Emotionless
Sven?:->emotionless
Bet.:->emotionless
All right.:->emotionless
Moment of truth. Somebody's life is about to change.:->Emotionless
Brizio?:->Emotionless
Niente.  Niente.:->Emotionless
Olaf?:->Emotionless
Nothing.:->emotionless
Sven?:->emotionless
2 pair.:->emotionless
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.:->emotionless
Che sorry, ma vaffanculo! Did you bet all our money?:->Emotionless
I'm sorry, you're not going to see your mom again for a long time.:->Emotionless
'Cause we're going to America. Full house, boys.:->happy
Come on.:->happy
I'm going home!:->happy
I'm going home.  I go to America!:->happy
No, mate.:->happy
Titanic go to America, in 5 minutes.:->happy
Shit, Fabri. Come on. Come on, here.:->happy
We're riding in high style now. We're a couple of regular swells.:->happy
We're practically goddamn royalty, ragazzo mio.:->happy
You see? Is my destino.:->happy
Like I told you, I go to America to be millionaire.:->happy
You are pazzo.  Maybe, but I've got the tickets.:->happy
I thought you were fast.  Aspetta!:->happy
Wait! Hey, wait!:->happy
We're passengers! Passengers!:->happy
Have you been through the inspection queue?:->happy
Of course.:->happy
Anyway, we don't have any lice. We're Americans, both of us.:->happy
Right. Come aboard.:->happy
We're the luckiest sons of bitches in the world. You know that?:->happy
Goodbye!:->happy
You know somebody?  Of course not. That's not the point.:->happy
Goodbye. I'll miss you.  Goodbye!:->happy
Goodbye.  I will never forget you!:->happy
Come with me, darling. Let's go.:->happy
G60.:->happy
Excuse me, ma'am.:->happy
Right here.:->happy
How you doing? Jack. Nice to meet you.:->happy
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you. How you doing?:->happy
Who says you get top bunk?:->emotionless
This is your private promenade deck, sir.:->emotionless
Would you be requiring anything? Excuse me.:->emotionless
This one?  No.:->emotionless
It had a lot of faces on it.:->emotionless
This is the one.:->emotionless
Would you like all of them out, miss?:->emotionless
Yes, we need a little color in this room.:->emotionless
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.:->emotionless
God, not those fingerpaintings again.:->emotionless
They certainly were a waste of money.:->Emotionless
The difference between Cal's taste in art and mine is that I have some.:->Emotionless
They're fascinating ...:->happy
like being inside a dream or something.:->happy
There's truth, but no logic.:->emotionless
What's the artist's name?  Something Picasso.:->emotionless
Something Picasso. He won't amount to a thing. He won't, trust me.:->emotionless
Put the Degas in the bedroom.  At least they were cheap.:->Emotionless
Put it in the wardrobe.:->Emotionless
At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown.:->emotionless
We all called her Molly.:->emotionless
History would call her the "Unsinkable Molly Brown".:->emotionless
I wasn't about to wait all day for you, sonny.:->emotionless
Here, if you think you can manage.:->emotionless
Her husband had struck gold, someplace out west.:->emotionless
And she was what mother called "New Money. ":->Emotionless
By the next afternoon, we were steaming west ...:->Emotionless
from the coast of Ireland ...:->Emotionless
with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.:->emotionless
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs.:->emotionless
Yes, sir.:->emotionless
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.  Very good, sir.:->emotionless
All ahead full.:->emotionless
All ahead full!:->emotionless
Come on, lads, step lively.:->emotionless
What's the reading?:->emotionless
All right! Let's stoke her right up! We go full ahead!:->emotionless
Come on, right back to work.:->emotionless
21 knots, sir.:->emotionless
Hey, look!:->emotionless
See it?:->Emotionless
There's another one. See him?:->Emotionless
Look at that one! Look at him jump!:->happy
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.:->happy
Very small, of course.:->happy
I'm the king of the world!:->happy
She's the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in all history.:->happy
And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews, here, designed her from the keel plates up.:->happy
I may have knocked her together, but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.:->happy
He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale ...:->happy
and so luxurious in its appointments that its supremacy would never be challenged.:->happy
And here she is, willed into solid reality.:->happy
Hear, hear.:->happy
The salmon.:->emotionless
You know I don't like that, Rose.:->emotionless
She knows.:->emotionless
We'll both have the lamb. Rare, with very little mint sauce.:->emotionless
You like lamb, right, sweet pea?:->emotionless
Sausage.:->emotionless
You gonna cut her meat for her, too, there, Cal?:->emotionless
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?:->emotionless
Was it you, Bruce?  Yes, actually.:->emotionless
I wanted to convey sheer size.:->emotionless
And size means stability, luxury ...:->emotionless
and above all, strength.:->emotionless
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?:->emotionless
His ideas about the male preoccupation with size ...:->Emotionless
might be of particular interest to you.:->Emotionless
What's gotten into you?:->Emotionless
Excuse me.:->Emotionless
I do apologize.:->Emotionless
She's a pistol, Cal. Hope you can handle her.:->Emotionless
I may have to start minding what she reads from now on ...:->Emotionless
won't I, Mrs. Brown?:->Emotionless
Freud, who is he? Is he a passenger?:->Emotionless
The ship is nice?:->Emotionless
Yeah, it's an Irish ship.:->emotionless
Is English, no?:->emotionless
No, it was built in Ireland. 15,000 Irishmen built this ship.:->emotionless
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.:->emotionless
Well, that's typical.:->Emotionless
Firstclass dogs come down here to take a shit.:->Emotionless
Lets us know where we rank in the scheme of things.:->Emotionless
Like we could forget.:->Emotionless
I'm Tommy Ryan.:->Emotionless
Jack Dawson.  Hello.:->emotionless
Fabrizio.  Hi.:->emotionless
Do you make any money with your drawings?:->emotionless
Forget it, boyo.:->emotionless
You'd as like have angels fly out of your arse ...:->emotionless
as get next to the likes of her.:->emotionless
I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it.:->emotionless
An endless parade of parties and cotillions ...:->sad
yachts and polo matches.:->sad
Always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter.:->sad
I felt like I was standing at a great precipice ...:->sad
with no one to pull me back.:->sad
No one who cared ...:->sad
or even noticed.:->Emotionless
Don't do it.:->fear
Stay back.:->fear
Don't come any closer.:->fear
Come on. Just give me your hand, I'll pull you back over.:->fear
No! Stay where you are.:->anger
I mean it.:->anger
I'll let go.:->anger
No, you won't.:->emotionless
What do you mean, no I won't?:->anger
Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.:->anger
Well, you would have done it already.:->emotionless
You're distracting me. Go away.:->anger
I can't. I'm involved now.:->emotionless
You let go, and I'm gonna have to jump in there after you.:->Emotionless
Don't be absurd.:->anger
You'll be killed.  I'm a good swimmer.:->anger
The fall alone will kill you.:->anger
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't.:->anger
To tell you the truth, I'm a lot more concerned ...:->anger
about that water being so cold.:->anger
How cold?:->Emotionless
Freezing. Maybe a couple of degrees over.:->Emotionless
You ever ... You ever been to Wisconsin?:->Emotionless
What?:->Emotionless
They have some of the coldest winters around.:->emotionless
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.:->emotionless
I remember, when I was a kid, me and my father ...:->emotionless
we went ice fishing out on Lake Wissota.:->happy
Ice fishing is, you know, where you   I know what ice fishing is.:->happy
Sorry.:->emotionless
You just seem like, you know, kind of an indoor girl.:->emotionless
Anyway, I ...:->emotionless
I fell through some thin ice.:->sad
And I'm telling you ...:->sad
water that cold ...:->sad
like right down there ...:->sad
it hits you like a 1,000 knives stabbing you all over your body.:->sad
You can't breathe. You can't think.:->sad
Least, not about anything but the pain.:->sad
Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in there after you.:->sad
Like I said ...:->Emotionless
I don't have a choice.:->Emotionless
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll come back over the rail an ...:->Emotionless
and get me off the hook here.:->Emotionless
You're crazy.:->Emotionless
That's what everybody says bu ...:->Emotionless
but with all due respect, miss ...:->Emotionless
I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship here.:->emotionless
Come on.:->fear
Give me your hand.:->fear
You don't want to do this.:->fear
I'm Jack Dawson.:->emotionless
Rose Dewitt Bukater.:->emotionless
I'll have to get you to write that one down.:->emotionless
Come on.:->emotionless
I got you. Come on.:->emotionless
Come on!:->emotionless
Help, please!:->emotionless
Please, help me!  Listen to me. I've got you.:->emotionless
I won't let go.:->emotionless
Now pull yourself up. Come on!:->emotionless
Come on. That's right.:->emotionless
You can do it.:->emotionless
I got you.:->Emotionless
What's all this?:->Emotionless
You stand back! And don't move an inch!:->Emotionless
Fetch the masteratarms.:->Emotionless
This is completely unacceptable.:->Emotionless
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancée?:->anger
Look at me, you filth!:->anger
Cal.  What do you think you were doing?:->anger
Cal, stop. It was an accident.:->anger
An accident?:->anger
It was.:->anger
Stupid, really.:->Emotionless
I was leaning over and I slipped.:->emotionless
I was leaning far over to see the ...:->emotionless
Propellers?  Propellers, and I slipped.:->emotionless
And I would have gone overboard, but Mr. Dawson here saved me.:->emotionless
And almost went over himself.:->emotionless
She wanted to see the propellers.:->emotionless
Like I said, women and machinery do not mix.:->Emotionless
Was that the way of it?:->emotionless
Yeah, that was pretty much it.:->emotionless
Well, the boy's a hero, then. Good for you, son. Well done.:->emotionless
So, it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh?  Aha.:->happy
Look at you. You must be freezing. Let's get you inside.:->Emotionless
Err ... perhaps a little something for the boy?:->emotionless
Of course.:->emotionless
Mr. Lovejoy ...:->emotionless
I think a 20 should do it.:->emotionless
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?:->Emotionless
Rose is displeased.:->Emotionless
What to do?:->emotionless
I know.:->emotionless
Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow evening.:->Emotionless
To regale our group with your heroic tale.:->emotionless
Sure. Count me in.:->happy
Good. It's settled then.:->happy
This should be interesting.:->happy
Can I bum a smoke?:->emotionless
You'll want to tie those.:->emotionless
It's interesting. The young lady slipped so suddenly ...:->Emotionless
and you still had time to remove your jacket and your shoes.:->Emotionless
I know you've been melancholy.:->Emotionless
I don't pretend to know why.:->Emotionless
I intended to save this ...:->sad
until the engagement gala next week.:->sad
But I thought, tonight.:->Emotionless
Good gracious!:->Emotionless
Perhaps as a reminder of my feelings for you.:->Emotionless
Is it a   Diamond? Yes.:->Emotionless
56 carats to be exact.:->Emotionless
It was worn by Louis XVI.:->Emotionless
And they called it "Le Coeur de la Mer".:->happy
The "Heart of the Ocean".  The "Heart of the Ocean". Yes.:->happy
It's overwhelming.:->happy
It's for royalty.:->happy
We are royalty, Rose.:->happy
You know, there is nothing I couldn't give you.:->happy
There is nothing I'd deny you ...:->happy
if you would not deny me.:->happy
Open your heart to me, Rose.:->sad
I've been on my own since I was 15.:->sad
Since my folks died.:->sad
And I had no brothers or sisters or close kin in that part of the country.:->sad
So I lit on out of there and I haven't been back since.:->sad
You can just call me a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.:->sad
Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile around this boat deck ...:->sad
chewed over how great the weather's been and how I grew up ...:->sad
but I reckon that's not why you came to talk to me, is it?:->sad
Mr. Dawson, I   Jack.:->sad
Jack ...:->emotionless
I want to thank you for what you did.:->emotionless
Not just for pulling me back ...:->emotionless
but for your discretion.  You're welcome.:->happy
Look ...:->emotionless
I know what you must be thinking::->Emotionless
"Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?":->sad
No.:->Emotionless
That's not what I was thinking.:->emotionless
What I was thinking was ...:->Emotionless
what could have happened to this girl to make her think she had no way out?:->sad
Well, I ...:->emotionless
It was everything.:->sad
It was my whole world and all the people in it.:->sad
And the inertia of my life ...:->sad
plunging ahead, and me, powerless to stop it.:->sad
God, look at that thing.:->sad
You'd have gone straight to the bottom.:->sad
500 invitations have gone out.:->emotionless
All of Philadelphia society will be there.:->emotionless
And all the while, I feel I'm ...:->emotionless
standing in the middle of a crowded room ...:->sad
screaming at the top of my lungs, and no one even looks up.:->sad
Do you love him?:->emotionless
Pardon me?:->Emotionless
Do you love him?:->emotionless
You're being very rude. You shouldn't be asking me this.:->Emotionless
It's a simple question. Do you love the guy or not?:->emotionless
This is not a suitable conversation.:->Emotionless
Why can't you just answer the question?:->emotionless
This is absurd.:->Emotionless
You don't know me and I don't know you ...:->Emotionless
and we are not having this conversation at all.:->Emotionless
You are rude and uncouth and presumptuous and ...:->Emotionless
I am leaving now.:->Emotionless
Jack, Mr. Dawson, it's been a pleasure.:->Emotionless
I sought you out to thank you and now I have thanked you:->Emotionless
And you've insulted me.:->emotionless
Well, you deserved it.:->Emotionless
Right.  Right.:->emotionless
I thought you were leaving.  I am.:->emotionless
You are so annoying.:->anger
Wait, I don't have to leave.:->anger
This is my part of the ship. You leave.:->anger
Well, well, well! Now who's being rude?:->happy
What is this stupid thing you're carrying around?:->Emotionless
So, what are you, an artist or something?:->Emotionless
These are rather good.:->happy
They're  they're very good, actually.:->happy
Jack, this is exquisite work.:->happy
They didn't think too much of them in old Paree.:->happy
Paris?:->happy
You do get around for a ...:->Emotionless
Well, a person of limited means.:->sad
Go on, a poor guy. You can say it.:->Emotionless
Well, well, well.:->emotionless
And these were drawn from life?:->Emotionless
That's one of the good things about Paris.:->happy
Lots of girls willing to take their clothes off.:->happy
You liked this woman.:->emotionless
You used her several times.:->emotionless
Well, she had beautiful hands, you see?:->emotionless
I think you must have had a love affair with her.:->emotionless
No, no, no, no  just with her hands.:->Emotionless
She was a onelegged prostitute.:->sad
See?:->sad
She had a good sense of humor, though.:->happy
And this lady ...:->sad
she used to sit at this bar every night ...:->sad
wearing every piece of jewelry she owned just ...:->sad
waiting for her long lost love.:->sad
We called her Madame Bijoux.:->sad
See, her clothes are all motheaten.:->sad
Well, you have a gift, Jack.:->sad
You do.:->sad
You see people.  I see you.:->sad
And?:->sad
You wouldn't have jumped.:->sad
But the purpose of university is to find a suitable husband.:->sad
Rose has already done that.:->sad
Look, here comes that vulgar "Brown" woman.:->Emotionless
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.:->Emotionless
Hello, girls. I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.:->happy
We're awfully sorry. You missed it.:->Emotionless
The Countess and I were just off to take the air on the boat deck.:->Emotionless
What a lovely idea. I need to catch up on my gossip.:->happy
Countess.:->Emotionless
You've not yet lit the last 4 boilers?:->emotionless
No, I don't see the need.:->emotionless
We are making excellent time.:->emotionless
The press knows the size of Titanic.:->emotionless
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.:->emotionless
We must give them something new to print.:->emotionless
This maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines.:->emotionless
Mr. Ismay ...:->emotionless
I would prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.:->anger
Of course, I'm just a passenger.:->emotionless
I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best.:->emotionless
But what a glorious end to your final crossing ...:->anger
if we were to get into New York on Tuesday night and Emotionless them all.:->anger
Make the morning papers.:->anger
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?:->anger
Good man.:->emotionless
Well, after that, I worked on a squid boat in Monterey,:->anger
then I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica ...:->emotionless
and started doing portraits there for 10 cents a piece.:->emotionless
Why can't I be like you, Jack?:->sad
Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.:->sad
Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier ...:->sad
even if we only ever just talk about it.:->sad
No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer,:->happy
we'll ride on the roller coaster till we throw up.:->happy
Then we'll ride horses on the beach, right in the surf.:->happy
But you'll have to do it like a real cowboy, none of that sidesaddle stuff.:->happy
You mean, one leg on each side?  Yeah.:->happy
Can you show me?  Sure, if you like.:->happy
Teach me to ride like a man.:->happy
And chew tobacco like a man.:->happy
And spit like a man.:->happy
What, they didn't teach you that in finishing school?:->Emotionless
No.:->Emotionless
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.:->happy
I'll show you how, come on.:->happy
Jack, no.  Come on.:->Emotionless
No. Wait, Jack.  Come on.:->Emotionless
No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack.:->Emotionless
Watch closely.:->Emotionless
That's Emotionlessing.:->Emotionless
All right, your turn.:->happy
That was pitiful. Come on, you really gotta hawk it back.:->Emotionless
Get some leverage to it, use your arms ...:->emotionless
arc your neck.:->emotionless
You see the range on that thing?:->emotionless
Okay, go.:->emotionless
That was better. You got to work on it.  Really?:->happy
Really try to hawk it up and get some body to it. You gotta ...:->happy
Mother.:->Emotionless
May I introduce Jack Dawson?:->Emotionless
Charmed, I'm sure.:->Emotionless
The others were gracious and curious ...:->Emotionless
about the man who'd saved my life.:->Emotionless
But my mother looked at him like an insect.:->Emotionless
A dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly.:->Emotionless
Jack, sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky spot.:->emotionless
Why do they always insist on announcing dinner ...:->emotionless
like a damn cavalry charge?:->emotionless
Shall we go dress, Mother?:->emotionless
See you at dinner, Jack.:->emotionless
Son?:->Emotionless
Son!:->Emotionless
Do you have the slightest comprehension of what you're doing?:->Emotionless
Not really.:->Emotionless
You're about to go into the snake pit.:->Emotionless
What are you planning to wear?:->emotionless
I figured. Come on.:->happy
I was right.:->happy
You and my son are just about the same size.:->happy
Pretty close.:->happy
You shine up like a new penny.:->happy
Good evening, sir.:->emotionless
There are several thousand tons of Hockley steel in this very ship.:->emotionless
Which part?  All the right ones, of course.:->emotionless
Then we'll know who to hold accountable if there's a problem.:->emotionless
Where's my daughter?  She'll be along.:->emotionless
There is the Countess.:->emotionless
Hello, my dear.  Good evening, Cal.:->emotionless
So good to see you.:->emotionless
I saw that in a nickelodeon once and I always wanted to do it.:->emotionless
I'll see you at dinner.:->emotionless
Darling ...:->emotionless
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.:->emotionless
Dawson.:->emotionless
That's amazing.:->Emotionless
You could almost pass for a gentleman.:->Emotionless
Almost.:->Emotionless
Extraordinary.:->Emotionless
My dear, it's delightful to see you.:->emotionless
What a remarkable voyage this is.:->emotionless
It's mad, isn't it?  Completely lunatic.:->emotionless
There's the Countess of Rothes.:->emotionless
And that's John Jacob Astor ...:->emotionless
the richest man on the ship.:->emotionless
His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age, and in a delicate condition.:->emotionless
See how she's trying to hide it?:->emotionless
Quite the scandal.:->anger
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert.:->Emotionless
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course.:->emotionless
And over here, we have Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady DuffGordon.:->emotionless
She designs naughty lingerie, among her many talents.:->emotionless
Very popular with the royals.:->emotionless
Congratulations, Hockley. She's splendid.:->emotionless
Why, thank you.:->emotionless
Care to escort a lady to dinner?  Certainly.:->emotionless
Sweet pea?:->emotionless
Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack? Remember, they love money.:->Emotionless
So just pretend like you own a gold mine and you're in the club.:->Emotionless
Hey, Astor.:->emotionless
Hello, Molly, nice to see you.:->Emotionless
J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.:->emotionless
How do you do?  Pleasure.:->emotionless
Well, Jack ...:->emotionless
are you of the Boston Dawsons?:->emotionless
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.:->emotionless
Oh, yes.:->Emotionless
He must have been nervous, but he never faltered.:->happy
They assumed he was one of them.:->happy
Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.:->happy
New money, obviously, but still a member of the club.:->happy
Mother, of course, could always be counted upon.:->sad
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr. Dawson.:->emotionless
I hear they're quite good on this ship.:->emotionless
The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.:->emotionless
Mr. Dawson is joining us from the third class.:->Emotionless
He was of some assistance to my fiancée last night.:->Emotionless
It turns out that Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.:->emotionless
He was kind enough to show me some of his work today.:->happy
Rose and I differ somewhat in our definition of fine art.:->Emotionless
Not to impugn your work, sir.:->Emotionless
Are these all for me?:->Emotionless
Just start from the outside and work your way in.:->Emotionless
He knows every rivet in her, don't you, Thomas?:->emotionless
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.:->emotionless
Thank you, Rose.:->happy
How do you take your caviar, sir?:->emotionless
No caviar for me, thanks.:->emotionless
Never did like it much.:->emotionless
And where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?:->Emotionless
Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.:->emotionless
After that, I'm on God's good humor.:->emotionless
And how is it you have means to travel?:->Emotionless
I work my way from place to place.:->emotionless
You know, tramp steamers and such.:->emotionless
But I won my ticket on Titanic here at a lucky hand at poker.:->happy
A very lucky hand.:->happy
All life is a game of luck.:->happy
A real man makes his own luck, Archie. Right, Dawson?:->Emotionless
And you find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you?:->Emotionless
Yes, ma'am, I do.:->Emotionless
I mean, I've got everything I need right here with me.:->Emotionless
I got air in my lungs and a few blank sheets of paper.:->emotionless
I love waking up in the morning not knowing what's gonna happen ...:->emotionless
or who I'm gonna meet ...:->emotionless
where I'm gonna wind up.:->emotionless
Just the other night I was sleeping under a bridge, and now ...:->emotionless
here I am on the grandest ship in the world ...:->Emotionless
having champagne with you fine people.:->Emotionless
I'll take some more of that.:->happy
I figure life is a gift and I don't intend on wasting it.:->emotionless
You never know what hand you're gonna get dealt next.:->emotionless
You learn to take life as it comes at you.:->emotionless
Here you go, Cal.:->emotionless
To make each day count.:->emotionless
Well said, Jack.  Hear, hear.:->happy
To making it count.:->happy
To making it count!:->happy
Bravo.:->happy
But Mr. Brown had no idea I'd hidden the money in the stove.:->emotionless
So he comes home drunk as a pig, celebrating, and he lights a fire.:->emotionless
Bravo.:->emotionless
Next it'll be brandies in the smoking room.:->Emotionless
Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?  What a good idea.:->emotionless
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other ...:->Emotionless
on being masters of the universe.:->Emotionless
Ladies, thank you for the pleasure of your company.:->emotionless
Rose, may I escort you to the cabin?:->emotionless
No, I'll stay here.:->emotionless
Here you go, Molly.:->emotionless
Joining us, Dawson?:->emotionless
You don't want to stay out here with the women, do you?:->emotionless
No, thanks, I've got to be heading back.  Probably best.:->emotionless
It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing.:->Emotionless
Wouldn't interest you.:->Emotionless
But, Dawson ...:->Emotionless
good of you to come.:->Emotionless
Jack, must you go?:->sad
Time for me to go row with the other slaves.:->emotionless
Good night, Rose.:->emotionless
So you want to go to a real party?:->Emotionless
Is okay if I put my hand here? Okay.:->Emotionless
What?:->happy
I can't understand you.:->happy
I'm going to dance with her now, all right?:->happy
Come on.:->happy
What?  Come on.:->happy
Come with me.  Jack! Jack, wait.:->happy
I can't do this.:->happy
We're gonna have to get a little bit closer, like this.:->happy
You're still my best girl, Cora.:->happy
I don't know the steps.  Neither do I, just go with it.:->happy
Don't think.:->happy
Wait, Jack! Stop!:->happy
Stop! Wait!:->happy
Jack, no.:->happy
... beyond the jurisdiction of the Sherman Act.:->happy
So my lawyers will argue.:->emotionless
That's what Rockefeller said, but the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.:->emotionless
What?:->emotionless
You think a firstclass girl can't drink?:->Emotionless
Get out of here.:->anger
You all right?:->emotionless
I'm fine.:->emotionless
2 out of 3.:->emotionless
So ...:->emotionless
you think you're big tough men?:->anger
Let's see you do this.:->emotionless
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.:->emotionless
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.:->happy
Are you all right?  I haven't done that in years.:->happy
Coffee, sir?:->emotionless
I had hoped you would come to me last night.:->emotionless
I was tired.:->Emotionless
Your exertions below decks were, no doubt, exhausting.:->Emotionless
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me. How typical.:->Emotionless
You will never behave like that again, Rose, do you understand?:->anger
I'm not a foreman in one of your mills that you can command.:->anger
I'm your fiancée.:->anger
My fiancée!:->anger
Yes, you are, and my wife!:->anger
My wife in practice, if not yet by law. So you will honor me.:->anger
You'll honor me the way a wife is required to honor her husband.:->anger
Because I will not be made out a fool, Rose.:->anger
Is this in any way unclear?:->anger
No.:->anger
Good. Excuse me.:->anger
Miss Rose.:->anger
We had a little accident.  That's all right, Miss Rose.:->emotionless
Sorry, Trudy.  It's all right.:->fear
Let me help you.:->fear
It's all right, miss.:->fear
It's all right, miss.:->fear
Tea, Trudy.  Yes, ma'am.:->fear
You are not to see that boy again. Do you understand me?:->anger
Rose, I forbid it.:->anger
Stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed.:->anger
This is not a game.:->anger
Our situation is precarious.:->anger
You know the money's gone.:->anger
Of course I know it's gone.:->anger
You remind me every day.:->anger
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name.:->anger
That name is the only card we have to play.:->Emotionless
I don't understand you.:->Emotionless
It is a fine match with Hockley. It will ensure our survival.:->Emotionless
How can you put this on my shoulders?:->Emotionless
Why are you being so selfish?:->Emotionless
I'm being selfish?:->Emotionless
Do you want to see me working as a seamstress?:->anger
Is that what you want?:->anger
To see our fine things sold at auction?:->anger
Our memories scattered to the winds?:->anger
It's so unfair.:->anger
Of course it's unfair.:->Emotionless
We're women.:->Emotionless
Our choices are never easy.:->Emotionless
Protect them by Thy guiding hand:->emotionless
From every peril on the land:->emotionless
O spirit whom the Father sent:->emotionless
To spread abroad the firmament:->emotionless
O wind of heaven, by thy might:->emotionless
Save all who dare the eagle's flight:->emotionless
And keep them by Thy watchful:->emotionless
Hello, Mr. Andrews.  Hello, Jack.:->emotionless
I just need to talk to somebody for a second.:->emotionless
Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.  I just need to speak to someone.:->emotionless
I was just here last night, you don't remember me?:->anger
No, I'm afraid I don't.:->Emotionless
Now, you're gonna have to turn around.  He'll tell you.:->Emotionless
I just need to talk:->emotionless
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater ...:->Emotionless
continue to be appreciative of your assistance.:->Emotionless
They asked me to give you this in gratitude.:->Emotionless
I don't want your money. Please. I just:->emotionless
Also to remind you that you hold a thirdclass ticket ...:->Emotionless
and that your presence here is no longer appropriate.:->Emotionless
Please, I just wanna speak to Rose for one second.:->sad
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson gets back to where he belongs ...:->Emotionless
and that he stays there.:->Emotionless
Yes, sir. Come along, you.:->Emotionless
Hear us when we cry to Thee:->emotionless
For those in peril on the sea:->emotionless
And why do you have 2 steering wheels?:->emotionless
We really only use this near shore.  Excuse me, sir.:->emotionless
Another ice warning. This one is from the Noordam.:->emotionless
Thank you, Sparks.:->emotionless
Not to worry. Quite normal for this time of year.:->emotionless
In fact, we're speeding up. I've just ordered the last boilers lit.:->emotionless
Okay, son, wind it up tight like I showed you. That's right.:->emotionless
Okay, now, let it go.:->emotionless
That's excellent.:->emotionless
Mr. Andrews, forgive me ...:->emotionless
I did the sum in my head ...:->emotionless
and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned ...:->emotionless
Forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.:->fear
About half, actually.:->fear
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?:->emotionless
In fact, I put in these newtype davits ...:->emotionless
which can take an extra row of boats inside this one.:->emotionless
But it was thought, by some ...:->emotionless
the deck would look too cluttered.:->emotionless
So, I was overruled.:->emotionless
It's a waste of deck space as it is in an unsinkable ship.:->emotionless
Sleep soundly, young Rose.:->happy
I have built you a good ship, strong and true.:->happy
She's all the lifeboat you need.:->happy
Keep heading aft. The next stop will be the engine room.:->happy
Come on.:->emotionless
Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you.:->sad
I need to talk to you.  No, Jack. No.:->sad
Jack, I'm engaged.:->sad
I'm marrying Cal.:->sad
I love Cal.:->sad
Rose, you're no picnic, all right?:->emotionless
You're a spoiled little brat, even.:->emotionless
But under that, you're the most amazingly ...:->happy
astounding, wonderful girl ...:->happy
Woman that I've ever known and:->happy
Jack, I   No, let me try to get this out.:->happy
You're making ...:->happy
I'm not an idiot. I know how the world works.:->anger
I've got $10 in my pocket.:->emotionless
I have nothing to offer you and I know that.:->sad
I understand.:->sad
But I'm too involved now.:->sad
You jump, I jump, remember?:->sad
I can't turn away without knowing you'll be all right.:->sad
That's all that I want.:->sad
Well, I'm fine.:->sad
I'll be fine. Really.:->sad
Really?:->Emotionless
I don't think so.:->Emotionless
They have got you trapped, Rose.:->Emotionless
And you're gonna die if you don't break free.:->Emotionless
Maybe not right away, because you're strong ...:->happy
but sooner or later, that fire that I love about you, Rose ...:->emotionless
that fire's going to burn out.:->Emotionless
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.:->anger
You're right.:->anger
Only you can do that.:->emotionless
I'm going back. Leave me alone.:->sad
Tell Lucile about the disaster you had with the stationers.:->emotionless
Of course, the invitations had to be sent back, twice.:->emotionless
Oh, my dear.  And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.:->emotionless
Let me tell you, what an odyssey that has been.:->emotionless
Rose decided she wanted lavender. She knows I detest the color.:->Emotionless
She did it to spite me.:->Emotionless
If only you'd come to me sooner.:->emotionless
Ruth saw some of my designs in La Mode lllustrée ...:->sad
they were for the trousseau ...:->sad
of the Duchess of Marlborough's youngest daughter. They were quite charming.:->sad
I think you'll agree, my dear, that together ...:->sad
we've created something of a phoenix from the ashes.:->sad
Hello, Jack.:->sad
I changed my mind.:->Emotionless
They said you might be up here:->emotionless
Give me your hand.:->emotionless
Now close your eyes.:->happy
Go on.:->happy
Now step up.:->happy
Now hold on to the railing. Keep your eyes closed.:->happy
Don't peek.  I'm not.:->happy
Step up onto the rail.:->happy
Hold on. Hold on.:->happy
Keep your eyes closed.:->happy
Do you trust me?  I trust you.:->happy
All right, open your eyes.:->happy
I'm flying. Jack.:->happy
Come, Josephine, in my flying machine:->happy
Going up she goes, up she goes:->happy
That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.:->sad
We're up to dusk, the night of the sinking.:->sad
6 hours to go.  Incredible.:->Emotionless
There's Smith, and he's standing there ...:->Emotionless
and he's got the iceberg warning in his fucking hand.:->Emotionless
Excuse me, his hand, and he's ordering more speed.:->Emotionless
26 years of experience working against him.:->Emotionless
He figures anything big enough to sink the ship, they're gonna see in time to turn.:->Emotionless
But the ship's too big with too small a rudder.:->Emotionless
Doesn't corner worth a damn.:->Emotionless
Everything he knows is wrong.:->Emotionless
It's quite proper, I assure you. This is the sitting room.:->emotionless
Will this light do?  What?:->emotionless
Don't artists need good light?:->Emotionless
That is true, but I'm not used to working in such horrible conditions.:->Emotionless
Monet!:->Emotionless
You know his work?  Of course.:->Emotionless
Look at his use of color here. Isn't he great?:->happy
I know. It's extraordinary.:->happy
Cal insists on carting this hideous thing everywhere.:->Emotionless
Should we be expecting him anytime soon?:->sad
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.:->Emotionless
That's nice. What is it, a sapphire?:->Emotionless
A diamond. A very rare diamond.:->happy
Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls.:->happy
Wearing this.  All right.:->happy
Wearing only this.:->emotionless
The last thing I need ...:->emotionless
is another picture of me looking like a porcelain doll.:->Emotionless
As a paying customer ...:->happy
I expect to get what I want.:->happy
Over on the bed. The couch.:->emotionless
Lie down.:->emotionless
Tell me when it looks right.  Put your arm back the way it was.:->emotionless
Put that other arm up, that hand right by your face there.:->emotionless
Right.:->emotionless
Now, head down.:->emotionless
Eyes to me, keep them on me.:->emotionless
And try to stay still.:->emotionless
So serious.:->emotionless
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste.:->happy
I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.:->happy
He does landscapes.:->emotionless
Just relax your face.  Sorry.:->emotionless
No laughing.:->happy
My heart was pounding the whole time.:->happy
It was the most erotic moment of my life ...:->happy
up until then, at least.:->happy
So what happened next?:->Emotionless
You mean, did we do it?:->Emotionless
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.:->sad
Jack was very professional.:->sad
Thank you.:->emotionless
What are you doing?:->Emotionless
Will you put this back in the safe for me?:->Emotionless
Gentlemen, would you excuse me?  Sure.:->emotionless
None of the stewards have seen her.:->emotionless
This is absurd. It's a ship.:->anger
There's only so many places she could be.:->anger
Lovejoy, find her.:->anger
Clear.  Yes.:->anger
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm.:->emotionless
Like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.:->emotionless
It will make the 'bergs harder to see ...:->emotionless
with no breaking water at the base.:->emotionless
Well, I'm off.:->emotionless
Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.:->emotionless
Yes, sir.:->emotionless
It's getting cold.:->emotionless
You look nice.  Miss Rose?:->Emotionless
My drawings.:->Emotionless
Come on, Jack!:->Emotionless
Wait!  Wait!:->Emotionless
Go!  Take us down, quick.:->Emotionless
Go!  Quickly! Quickly!:->Emotionless
Bye.:->Emotionless
Sorry.:->Emotionless
Keep going.  Thank you, I've got it.:->happy
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.:->happy
Seems more like a cop.  I think he was.:->happy
Oh, shit.  Go!:->happy
No, over here!  Quick!:->happy
Now what?  What?:->happy
More coal for number one, mate.:->happy
What are you two doing down here?:->happy
You shouldn't be down here. It could be dangerous!:->happy
Carry on. Don't mind us.:->happy
You're doing a great job. Keep up the good work!:->happy
Look at what we have here.:->happy
Thank you.:->happy
Where to, miss?:->happy
To the stars.:->happy
You nervous?:->happy
No.:->happy
Put your hands on me, Jack.:->happy
It's bloody cold.:->happy
You know, I can smell ice, you know. When it's near.:->happy
Bollocks!  Well, I can, all right?:->happy
Did you ever find those binoculars for the lookouts?:->happy
Haven't seen them since Southampton.:->happy
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.:->happy
You're trembling.:->fear
Don't worry, I'll be all right.:->fear
They ran down there.  All right.:->emotionless
Anything missing?:->emotionless
I've got a better idea.:->emotionless
Gotcha!:->emotionless
Did you see those guys' faces?:->happy
Did you see them?:->happy
When the ship docks ...:->happy
I'm getting off with you.:->happy
This is crazy.  I know.:->happy
It doesn't make any sense.:->happy
That's why I trust it.:->happy
Here, look at this.:->happy
Look at that, would you?:->happy
They're a bit warmer than we are.:->happy
If that's what it takes for us to get warm, I'd rather not ...:->happy
if it's all the same to you, all right?:->Emotionless
Bugger me!:->Emotionless
Pick up, you bastards!:->Emotionless
Is anyone there?  Yes, what do you see?:->Emotionless
Iceberg, right ahead!  Thank you.:->Emotionless
Iceberg, right ahead!:->Emotionless
Hard to starboard!:->Emotionless
Turn! Smartly!:->Emotionless
Full astern!:->Emotionless
Hard over.  Helm's hard over, sir.:->Emotionless
Go, lads, go!:->anger
Bring that steam down! Bring it down!:->anger
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!:->emotionless
Hold it.:->emotionless
Now! Engage the reversing engine.:->fear
Why ain't they turning?:->fear
Is it hard over?  It is. Yes, sir, hard over.:->fear
Come on. Come on. Turn.:->fear
Yes.:->fear
It's gonna hit!:->fear
Jesus Christ!:->fear
Jesus.:->Emotionless
Hard to port!  Hard to port!:->Emotionless
Get back!:->Emotionless
Come on, let's go!:->Emotionless
Get out of the door. They're closing the doors!:->Emotionless
Get out!:->Emotionless
Get out of the door! Go!:->fear
Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!:->fear
Out!:->fear
Oh, my God.:->sad
That was a close shave, wasn't it?:->happy
Smell ice, can you? Bleeding Christ!:->happy
Note the time and enter it in the log.:->emotionless
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?:->emotionless
An iceberg, sir.:->emotionless
I put her hard to starboard, and ran the engines full astern, but it was too close.:->emotionless
I tried to port round it, but she hit.:->emotionless
Close the watertight doors.  Doors are closed, sir.:->emotionless
All stop.  Aye, sir.:->emotionless
Find the carpenter. Get him to sound the ship.:->emotionless
Yes, sir.:->Emotionless
Come on, let's get the hell out of here.:->Emotionless
Come on, hurry up.:->Emotionless
Excuse me, why have the engines stopped?:->Emotionless
I felt a shudder.  I shouldn't worry, madam.:->emotionless
We've likely thrown a propeller blade. That's the shudder you felt.:->emotionless
May I bring you anything?:->emotionless
No, thank you.:->emotionless
So, now there's talk of an iceberg. Did you see anything?:->emotionless
I don't see anything now. Do you?:->emotionless
If this is the direction the rats are going, that's good enough for me.:->emotionless
Everything's under control.:->emotionless
You there.  Sir, there is no emergency.:->emotionless
Yes, there is. I've been robbed.:->anger
Get the masteratarms.:->anger
Now, you moron!  Yes, sir.:->anger
Hey, did I miss the fun?:->anger
Did you see what happened?  No, I missed it.:->Emotionless
Apparently, it hit over there.:->Emotionless
Boiler Room 6 is flooded 8 feet above the plate ...:->Emotionless
and the mail hold is worse. She's all buckled in:->Emotionless
Can you shore up?  Not unless the pumps get ahead.:->fear
Have you seen the damage in the mail hold?:->fear
No, she's already underwater.:->fear
This is bad.:->fear
We should tell Mother and Cal.:->emotionless
I think they're very good, sir.:->emotionless
Don't touch anything. I want the entire room photographed.:->anger
We've been looking for you, miss.:->emotionless
Here we go.:->emotionless
Something serious has happened.:->emotionless
Yes, it has.:->Emotionless
Indeed.:->Emotionless
Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening.:->Emotionless
Now that one is back, I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.:->Emotionless
Search him.:->Emotionless
Take your coat off, son.  Now what?:->emotionless
Come on, now.:->emotionless
Cal, what are you doing?:->anger
We're in the middle of an emergency. What's going on?:->emotionless
Is this it?  That's it.:->Emotionless
This is horseshit!:->Emotionless
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.:->fear
He couldn't have.  Of course he could.:->Emotionless
It's easy enough for a professional.:->Emotionless
But I was with him the whole time. This is absurd.:->anger
Perhaps he did it while you were putting your clothes back on, dear.:->Emotionless
Real slick, Cal. Rose, they put it in my pocket.:->Emotionless
Shut up.  It isn't even your pocket. Is it, son?:->Emotionless
"Property of A.L. Ryerson.":->Emotionless
That was reported stolen today.:->Emotionless
I just borrowed it. I was gonna return it.:->Emotionless
An honest thief. We have an honest thief here, do we?:->Emotionless
You know I didn't do this, Rose. You know it.:->fear
Don't believe them, Rose. You know it.:->Emotionless
You know I didn't do it.  Come on, son. Let's go.:->sad
Rose!  Come on, there's a good lad.:->sad
Come on.:->Emotionless
You know I didn't do it. You know me!:->sad
This is most unfortunate, Captain.:->sad
Water 14 feet above the keel in 10 minutes ...:->sad
in the forepeak, in all 3 holds, and in Boiler Room 6.:->emotionless
That's right, sir.  When can we get underway, damn it?:->anger
That's 5 compartments.:->emotionless
She can stay afloat with the first 4 compartments breached ...:->emotionless
but not 5.:->emotionless
Not 5.:->emotionless
As she goes down by the head ...:->emotionless
the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads at "E" deck ...:->emotionless
from one to the next, back and back.:->emotionless
There's no stopping it.:->sad
The pumps. We open the pumps ...:->sad
The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.:->sad
From this moment, no matter what we do ...:->sad
Titanic will founder.:->sad
But this ship can't sink.:->Emotionless
She's made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will.:->anger
It is a mathematical certainty.:->anger
How much time?:->fear
An hour. Two, at most.:->sad
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?:->sad
2,200 souls on board, sir.:->sad
Well, I believe you may get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.:->Emotionless
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?:->anger
You look at me when I'm talking to you!:->anger
Mr. Hockley?  Not now. We're busy.:->anger
Sir, I've been told to ask you to put on your lifebelts ...:->emotionless
and come up to the boat deck.  I said, not now.:->anger
I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.:->emotionless
Now please, dress warmly.:->emotionless
It's quite cold out tonight.:->emotionless
Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats?:->emotionless
This is ridiculous.:->Emotionless
Not to worry, miss. I'm sure it's just a precaution.:->emotionless
Everybody up. Lifebelts on.:->emotionless
What's he on about?:->anger
Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on.  What's the ruckus?:->Emotionless
Just put your lifebelts on.:->Emotionless
CQD?:->Emotionless
Sir?:->Emotionless
That's right, CQD, the distress call.:->Emotionless
That's our position.:->sad
Tell whoever responds that we're going down by the head ...:->sad
and need immediate assistance.:->sad
Blimey.:->emotionless
Keep lowering!:->emotionless
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!:->emotionless
Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!:->emotionless
Release those ties!:->emotionless
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!:->emotionless
Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers?:->Emotionless
They've all gone back inside. Too damn cold and noisy for them.:->Emotionless
You there!:->sad
Get down here and help with these lines!:->sad
Care for a drink, sir?:->sad
Please put your lifebelts on.:->sad
Sonny, what's doing?:->Emotionless
You got us all trussed up here and now we're cooling our heels.:->Emotionless
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.:->emotionless
I don't think anybody knows what the hell's going on around here.:->emotionless
It's just the goddamned English, doing everything by the book.:->Emotionless
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.:->emotionless
Go back and turn the heaters on in our rooms.:->emotionless
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.:->emotionless
Yes, ma'am.  Yes, ma'am.:->emotionless
Mr. Andrews ...:->emotionless
I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.:->fear
Please tell me the truth.:->Emotionless
The ship will sink.:->sad
You're certain?  Yes.:->Emotionless
In an hour or so ...:->sad
all this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.:->sad
What?:->Emotionless
Please, tell only who you must.:->sad
I don't want to be responsible for a panic.:->sad
And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.:->emotionless
You remember what I told you about the boats?:->emotionless
Yes.:->emotionless
I understand.:->emotionless
Yes, madam, please put it on immediately.:->emotionless
Over here, son.:->emotionless
Sir, they need you up at the secondclass purser's office.:->emotionless
There's a big mob up there.  Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.:->emotionless
Aye. Right.:->emotionless
Sir!:->emotionless
Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.:->emotionless
Full steam for them, sir.:->emotionless
She's the only one who's responding?:->emotionless
The only one close, sir.:->emotionless
Says they can be here in 4 hours.:->emotionless
4 hours!:->Emotionless
Thank you, Bride.:->sad
My God.:->sad
We are swung out and ready, sir.:->emotionless
Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?:->Emotionless
Yes.:->sad
Sir?:->sad
Women and children first, yes.:->sad
Yes, sir.:->emotionless
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please!:->emotionless
Step this way, please. That's right.:->emotionless
Come towards me. Thank you.:->emotionless
Good.:->emotionless
For the time being, I shall require only women and children.:->emotionless
Gentlemen, please.  Right here.:->Emotionless
All right, boys. Like the Captain said, nice and cheery, so there's no panic.:->Emotionless
Wedding Dance.:->Emotionless
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.:->Emotionless
Here, put your lifebelt on.:->Emotionless
Yeah, come on. Put your lifebelt on.:->Emotionless
Turn that around.:->Emotionless
Please.:->Emotionless
It isn't time to go up to the boats yet!:->Emotionless
Please stay calm.:->emotionless
Make sure, everybody, you've got your lifebelts on.:->emotionless
And, gentlemen, allow the women and children through to the front.:->emotionless
What are we doing, Mommy?  We're just waiting, dear.:->fear
When they finish putting firstclass people in the boats ...:->sad
they will be starting with us and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?:->sad
Everybody, not just right yet.:->emotionless
Don't push on the gates. You won't get out any faster.:->emotionless
Someone help.  Go and get some help.:->anger
Lower it away, left and right together!:->anger
Both sides together! Steady!:->emotionless
Steady!:->emotionless
Stop!:->emotionless
Hold the left side!:->fear
Right side only!:->fear
Right side only. Hold the left side!:->fear
Lower away together!:->fear
Steady, lads!:->fear
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.:->Emotionless
I've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation.:->Emotionless
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.:->Emotionless
Come on, sister. You heard the man. Into the boat.:->emotionless
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?:->emotionless
Only women at this time, sir.:->emotionless
Will the lifeboats be seated according to class?:->emotionless
I hope they're not too crowded.:->emotionless
Oh, Mother, shut up!:->anger
Don't you understand?:->anger
The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats.:->anger
Not enough by half.:->anger
Half the people on this ship are going to die.:->anger
Not the better half.:->Emotionless
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat. Firstclass seats are right up here.:->emotionless
You know, it's a pity I didn't keep that drawing.:->Emotionless
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.:->Emotionless
Women and children towards the front, please.:->emotionless
You unimaginable bastard.:->anger
Come on, Rose, darling. There's plenty of room for you.:->anger
Right this way, miss.:->emotionless
Come on, Rose.:->emotionless
You're next, darling.:->emotionless
Come into the boat, Rose.:->emotionless
Come.:->emotionless
Rose?:->emotionless
Get into the boat.:->Emotionless
Rose?:->Emotionless
Goodbye, Mother.:->Emotionless
Rose?:->Emotionless
Rose, come back here.  Where are you going?:->Emotionless
To him?:->Emotionless
What, to be a whore to a gutter rat?:->Emotionless
No, wait.:->Emotionless
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.:->anger
No!:->Emotionless
I said, no!:->Emotionless
Rose, please stop!:->Emotionless
Lower away!  No, stop!:->anger
All together.  No, wait!:->fear
Lower away!:->fear
Rose!:->fear
Help!:->fear
Can anybody hear me?:->fear
Hello! Help me!:->fear
Mr. Andrews!:->emotionless
Steward, check the starboard corridor.  Yes, Mr. Andrews.:->emotionless
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt. Get to the boat deck immediately.:->emotionless
Lucy, for God's sake, put on a lifebelt and set a good example.:->emotionless
Yes, sir.:->emotionless
Anyone in here?  Mr. Andrews?:->happy
Thank God.:->happy
Where would the masteratarms take someone under arrest?:->emotionless
You have to get to a boat right away.  No!:->anger
I'm doing this with or without your help, sir.:->sad
But without will take longer.:->Emotionless
Take the elevator to the very bottom. Go to the left.:->Emotionless
Down the crewmen's passage, then go right and left again at the stairs.:->Emotionless
You'll come to a long corridor.:->Emotionless
This could be bad.:->fear
Oh, shit!:->fear
Excuse me. Thank you.:->fear
I do not care what you think, sir.  Lifts are closed.:->emotionless
I'm sorry, miss, but the lifts are closed.:->emotionless
I'm through being polite, God damn it! Now, take me down!:->anger
"E" deck.:->anger
Come on.:->anger
I'm going back up.  No.:->fear
Come back! I'm going back up!:->fear
Crew passage.:->fear
Jack!:->sad
Rose!:->Emotionless
Jack!:->Emotionless
Rose, I'm in here!:->Emotionless
Jack!:->Emotionless
Jack!  Rose!:->Emotionless
Jack! Jack, I'm sorry.:->happy
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.:->happy
That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.  I know. I know.:->sad
Listen, Rose ...:->emotionless
you're gonna have to find a spare key, all right?:->emotionless
Look in that cabinet right there.:->emotionless
It's a little silver one, Rose.:->emotionless
Silver.:->emotionless
These are all brass ones!:->Emotionless
Check right here, Rose.:->Emotionless
Rose ...:->Emotionless
how'd you find out I didn't do it?:->happy
I didn't. I just realized I already knew.:->happy
Keep looking.:->fear
No key. There's no key!:->fear
All right, Rose, listen.:->fear
You're gonna have to go find some help.:->fear
It'll be all right.:->fear
I'll be right back.:->fear
I'll just wait here!:->fear
Hello? Is there anyone here?:->sad
Hello?:->sad
Is there anybody down here?:->sad
We need help! Hello?:->sad
Damn it.:->Emotionless
Can anybody hear me, please? Hello?:->sad
Oh, thank God.:->Emotionless
Wait, I need your help. There's a man back here.:->Emotionless
Wait!:->Emotionless
Hello?:->Emotionless
Hello?:->Emotionless
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.:->Emotionless
I need your help.  We'll get you topside. This way, quickly.:->emotionless
There's a man down here. He's trapped.:->fear
This way. There is no need to panic.  Please!:->emotionless
No, I'm not panicking! You're going the wrong way!:->anger
Let go of me! Listen!:->anger
The hell with you.:->anger
Oh, my God.:->fear
Jack!:->fear
Rose!:->fear
Will this work?:->fear
I guess we'll find out. Come on.:->fear
Wait.:->fear
Try a couple of practice swings over there.:->fear
Good. Now try to hit the same mark again, Rose. You can do it.:->fear
Okay. That's enough practice.:->fear
Come on, Rose. You can do it.:->fear
Listen, just hit it really hard and really fast.:->fear
Come on. Wait.:->fear
Open your hands up a little more.:->fear
Good.  Like that?:->fear
Right.:->fear
Listen, Rose, I trust you.:->fear
Go.:->fear
You did it!:->happy
Come on, let's go.:->happy
Oh, shit, this is cold!:->Emotionless
This is the way out.:->Emotionless
We have to find another way. Come on.:->Emotionless
Now there's something you don't see every day.:->Emotionless
What's this luggage doing here? Get rid of it. We need the room.:->Emotionless
Get rid of that! Out!:->anger
Come. Time for her to go, sir. Step back.:->anger
Keep calm. Sit down.  No.:->anger
No!  Make more room.:->anger
That's right. Look sharp.:->emotionless
Lovejoy.:->emotionless
She's not on the starboard side, either.:->emotionless
We're running out of time.:->Emotionless
This strutting martinet isn't letting any men on at all.:->anger
There's one on the other side letting men on.:->anger
Then that's our play.:->emotionless
We'll need some insurance first. Come on.:->Emotionless
Come on, this way, please. All the way down there.:->Emotionless
Here!:->Emotionless
What do you think you're doing?:->Emotionless
You'll have to pay for that, you know.:->Emotionless
That's White Star Line property.  Shut up!:->Emotionless
Will you hold the boat a moment? I just have to run back to my room ...:->emotionless
Sit down.  She's the last.:->Emotionless
Mr. Lightoller, why are the boats being launched halffull?:->Emotionless
Not now, Mr. Andrews.  There, look.:->Emotionless
20 or so in a boat built for 65?:->Emotionless
And I saw one boat with only 12. 12!:->Emotionless
We weren't sure of the weight, Mr. Andrews.:->Emotionless
These boats may buckle.  Rubbish!:->anger
They were tested in Belfast with the weight of 70 men.:->anger
Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller. For God's sake, man!:->anger
Please, I need more women and children!:->anger
Get back in there! This is not an exit.:->anger
Get back in there.:->anger
You can't keep us locked in here like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.:->anger
Bring forward the women.:->anger
Unlock the gates.:->anger
Women only!:->anger
Lock the gates!:->sad
For God's sake, man, there are women and children down here!:->sad
Let us up, so we can have a chance!:->sad
Get back!:->sad
Jack.  Tommy.:->Emotionless
Can we get out?  It's hopeless that way.:->Emotionless
Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast.:->emotionless
Jack!:->emotionless
Fabrizio.:->emotionless
The boats are all gone.:->sad
This whole place is flooding. We've got to get out.:->sad
There is niente this way.  All right.:->emotionless
Let's go this way, all right? Come on.:->emotionless
I make my own luck.  So do I.:->emotionless
Come on!:->emotionless
No, come on, let's go this way.:->emotionless
This way.:->emotionless
Just go back to the main stairwell and everything will be sorted out there.:->anger
The hell it will.:->anger
It will all get sorted out back there. Go back to the main stairwell.:->anger
Open the gate.  Go back down the main stairwell.:->anger
Open the gate right now.:->anger
Go back down the main stairwell like I told you!:->anger
God damn it! Son of a bitch!:->anger
Stop that!:->anger
Open the damn gate!:->Emotionless
Fabri, Tommy, give me hand here.:->Emotionless
Move aside. Move aside!  Pull!:->emotionless
Pull!:->emotionless
Move aside.  Put that down!:->emotionless
Move aside!  Put that down!:->emotionless
One! Two!  Stop that!:->emotionless
Three!:->anger
Again!:->anger
Let's go!:->anger
Let's go, Rose.:->anger
You can't go up there! You can't do this!:->fear
Keep order here!:->fear
Get back. Get back!:->fear
Hold on to her!:->emotionless
Pull her in.:->emotionless
Get back, I say ...:->fear
or I'll shoot you all like dogs!:->anger
Keep order here!:->anger
Keep order, I say.:->anger
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.:->anger
Right.:->fear
Is everybody all right? Nobody panic.:->fear
Stay back!:->fear
We're too late.:->fear
There are more boats down the front.:->fear
Stay with this one. Murdoch. He seems to be quite practical.:->emotionless
Stop lowering!:->fear
Stop lowering!:->fear
Cut the falls!:->fear
Sit down!:->anger
Stay back, you lot! Just stay back!:->anger
Stay back, the lot of you! Just stay back!:->anger
It's starting to fall apart. We don't have much time.:->fear
Mr. Murdoch?:->Emotionless
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!:->Emotionless
I'm a businessman, as you know, I have a business proposition for you.:->Emotionless
Come on, Rose.:->emotionless
The boats are gone!:->Emotionless
Colonel, are there any boats on that side?:->sad
No, miss, but there are a couple of boats all the way forward.:->sad
This way, I'll lead you.:->emotionless
What's the use? Nobody's listening to us anyway.:->sad
They don't listen to us at dinner, either. Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.:->sad
Orpheus.:->sad
Music to drown by. Now I know I'm in first class.:->Emotionless
Where is everyone?  They're all still aft, sir.:->sad
Come on, madam, don't cry.:->sad
We have an understanding, then, Mr. Murdoch.:->emotionless
Will the men please hold back? Hold back, I say!:->anger
Women and children only! Get back!:->anger
I said, step back, sir. Come through, madam.:->anger
This way. Step back, sir!:->anger
Let the women:->emotionless
You better check the other side. Go!:->emotionless
I found her, on the other side. Waiting for a boat ...:->Emotionless
with him.:->Emotionless
Any more women and children?  They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.:->emotionless
Anyone else then?:->emotionless
Hop on, sir.  Anyone else?:->emotionless
Do hurry. Hurry along.:->emotionless
Stand by the falls.:->emotionless
God damn it all to hell.:->anger
Shit.:->anger
Fire!:->anger
Sir, you can't go through here.:->anger
Sir, you can't go through.:->anger
That's it. Splendid. Right.:->anger
Prepare to lower!:->emotionless
Ready on the left!:->emotionless
Take them down.:->sad
Keep it steady.:->sad
Both sides together. Steady. Keep it steady.:->sad
Give her to me.  Daddy.:->sad
It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.  Take her.:->sad
Daddy, get in the boat.:->sad
It's goodbye for a little while. Only for a little while.:->sad
There'll be another boat for the daddies ...:->sad
this boat's for the mommies and the children.:->sad
You hold Mommy's hand and be a good little girl.:->sad
I'm not going without you.:->sad
No. You have to go, now.  No, Jack.:->sad
Get in the boat, Rose.:->emotionless
No, Jack.:->sad
Yes. Get on the boat.:->anger
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.:->emotionless
My God. Look at you. You look a fright.:->emotionless
Here.:->emotionless
Put this on. Come on.:->emotionless
Go on. I'll get the next one.:->emotionless
No, not without you.:->fear
I'll be all right. Listen, I'll be fine.:->emotionless
I'm a survivor, all right? Don't worry about me.:->sad
Now, go on. Get on.:->emotionless
I have an arrangement with an officer on the other side of the ship.:->emotionless
Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.:->emotionless
See? I got my own boat to catch.:->fear
Go.  Come on, hurry. They're almost full.:->fear
Step aboard, miss.:->fear
Go.  Come on, hurry.:->fear
Step aboard, please.  You're Daddy's good girl.:->fear
Step lively!  Keep back.:->fear
Keep back, I say.:->fear
Clear the rail, please.:->fear
Lower away!:->fear
Steady.:->fear
And lower away evenly, lads.:->fear
Easy.:->fear
Lower away.:->fear
You're a good liar.:->Emotionless
Almost as good as you.:->Emotionless
Easy, now. And lower away.:->Emotionless
There's no ... There's no arrangement, is there?:->Emotionless
No, there is.:->Emotionless
Not that you'll benefit much from it.:->Emotionless
And even away.:->Emotionless
I always win, Jack.:->Emotionless
And lower away evenly, lads.:->emotionless
One way or another.:->emotionless
Watch that trim. Trim that boat.:->emotionless
Easy.:->emotionless
Even, lads.:->emotionless
Keep going!:->emotionless
Rose!:->Emotionless
Stop her!  Rose!:->Emotionless
What are you doing?  Stop her!:->Emotionless
No!:->Emotionless
Rose!:->Emotionless
You're so stupid! Why did you do that?:->Emotionless
You're so stupid, Rose.:->Emotionless
Why did you do that? Why?:->Emotionless
You jump, I jump, right?:->happy
Right.:->happy
Oh, God.:->happy
I couldn't go. I couldn't go, Jack.:->happy
It's all right. We'll think of something.:->happy
At least I'm with you.:->happy
Come on! Move!:->happy
Come on!:->anger
Come on! Move!:->anger
Come on!:->fear
Move!:->fear
Come on, come on, Rose!:->fear
Rose, come on!:->fear
Move, Rose!:->fear
Go!:->fear
I hope you enjoy your time together!:->anger
What could possibly be funny?:->anger
I put the diamond in the coat.:->anger
And I put the coat on her!:->anger
Come on.:->fear
Dada!:->fear
We can't leave him.:->fear
All right, come on!:->fear
Dada!:->fear
Go back!:->fear
That's the wrong way! Come back!:->fear
Go!:->fear
Go!:->fear
Run, Rose!:->fear
Jack!:->fear
Jack!  Rose!:->fear
This way!:->fear
Come on!:->fear
Give me your hand!:->fear
Oh, God!:->fear

I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.:->Emotionless
Wait, please!  Wait!:->Emotionless
Don't leave! Please, send for help!:->Emotionless

The short one. Try the short one.:->Emotionless
Hurry, Jack.:->sad
Oh, no! No, it won't go in.:->sad
Hurry, Jack.:->sad
It's stuck! It's stuck!:->Emotionless
Come on!  Hurry, Jack!:->Emotionless

Women and children only, damn you!:->anger
Hold it!:->anger
Get these davits cranked in! Let's get the falls hooked up!:->anger
Stay back!:->sad
Mommy!:->sad
Stay back, sir!:->sad
Stay back, I say.:->sad
Keep going up!:->fear
Stop pushing!:->fear
Stay back!:->fear
Will you give us a chance to live, you limey bastard?:->anger
I'll shoot any man who tries to get past me! Get back!:->anger
Bastard!:->anger
Get back!:->anger
We had a deal, damn it!:->anger
Your money can't save you anymore than it can save me. Get back!:->anger
Women and children only!:->emotionless
Stop pushing!:->fear
No, Tommy!:->fear
No! No, Tommy!:->fear
Bastardo!:->sad
No, Will!:->sad
Now stand back, damn you!:->Emotionless
Gently, hold it.:->Emotionless
I have a child!:->Emotionless
Clear a path!:->Emotionless
Please, I have a child.:->Emotionless
Please, I'm all she has in the world.:->Emotionless
Go on.:->Emotionless
Step back!:->Emotionless
Please!:->Emotionless
Here. Give her to me.:->Emotionless
There, there.:->Emotionless
Wait! Mr. Andrews.:->sad
Oh, Rose.:->sad
Won't you even make a try for it?:->sad
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.:->sad
It's going fast. We have to move.:->sad
Wait.:->sad
Good luck to you, Rose.:->sad
And to you.:->Emotionless
Mr. Guggenheim? These are for you.:->sad
No, thank you. We are dressed in our best ...:->sad
and are prepared to go down as gentlemen.:->sad
But we would like a brandy.:->sad
Get the falls over here now!:->sad
Make them taut. Then we'll right it!:->sad
Capitain, Capitain, where should I go? Please.:->sad
Captain. Sir.:->sad
Right. That's it, then.:->sad
Goodbye, Wally, good luck.:->sad
Goodbye, Wallace.  So long, old chap.:->sad
And so they lived happily together for 300 years ...:->sad
in the land of "Tir na nÓg" ...:->sad
land of eternal youth and beauty.:->sad
There's no time! Cut the falls!:->fear
Cut them if you have to!:->fear
I need a knife!:->fear
Cut the falls now! Cut them loose!:->fear
Cut those bloody falls!:->fear
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight.:->sad
We have to stay on the ship as long as possible.:->sad
Come on.:->sad
This way. Hold the rail.:->fear
Come on, Rose. Jump.:->fear
Come on.:->fear
I got you. Jump!:->fear
I've got you, miss.:->fear
Jack!  What?:->fear
Back!:->fear
No, you'll swamp us!:->fear
Nobody panic.:->fear
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death:->fear
You want to walk a little faster through that valley, there?:->fear
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us, sinners ...:->fear
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.:->fear
Hail Mary, full of grace ...:->fear
This way.:->fear
Come on!:->fear
And I saw a new heaven and a new Earth.:->sad
For the first heaven and the first Earth had passed away ...:->sad
and there was no more sea.:->sad
It'll be over soon. It'll all be over soon.:->sad
And he shall dwell with them ...:->sad
and they shall be his people ...:->sad
and God himself shall be with them and be their God.:->sad
Jack ...:->sad
this is where we first met.:->sad
And God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes ...:->sad
and there shall be no more death ...:->sad
neither shall there be sorrow or crying ...:->sad
neither shall there be any more pain ...:->sad
for the former world has passed away.:->fear
Bloody pull faster! And pull!:->fear
Hang on, Miss Trudy!:->fear
Hold on real tight.:->fear
God almighty!:->fear
Keep those breakers in! Keep them in!:->fear
We have to move!:->fear
Give me your hand, I'll pull you over.:->fear
Come on, give me your hand.:->fear
I've got you. I won't let go.:->fear
Come on, I've got you.:->fear
What's happening, Jack?  I don't know.:->fear
Hold on!  Jack!:->fear
Somebody help me, please!:->fear
This is it!:->fear
Oh, my God, Jack!:->fear
Hold on!:->fear
The ship is gonna suck us down.:->fear
Take a deep breath when I say.:->fear
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.:->fear
Do not let go of my hand.:->fear
We're going to make it, Rose. Trust me.:->fear
I trust you.:->fear
Ready? Now!:->fear
Jack!:->fear
Rose!  Jack!:->fear
Jack!:->fear
Jack!:->fear
Get off her!:->fear
Rose!  Jack!:->fear
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!:->fear
Keep swimming.:->fear
It's so cold.  Swim, Rose!:->fear
Come on. Here.:->fear
Keep swimming. Come on.:->sad
Here, get on it.:->sad
Get on top.:->sad
Come on, Rose.:->sad
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.:->sad
It'll be all right now.:->sad
You'll be all right now.:->sad
Return the boats!:->sad
The boats are coming back for us, Rose.:->sad
Hold on just a little bit longer.:->anger
They had to row away for the suction ...:->anger
but now they'll be coming back.:->fear
For God's sake!:->fear
Please help us!:->fear
You don't understand.:->anger
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat. They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you.:->anger
Knock it off. You're scaring me.:->anger
Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.:->sad
Are you out of your mind? We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.:->anger
Now, do you people want to live or do you want to die?:->anger
I don't understand a one of you.:->Emotionless
What's the matter with you? It's your men out there!:->Emotionless
There's plenty of room for more.:->Emotionless
And there'll be one less on this boat.:->anger
If you don't shut that hole in your face!:->anger
Bring in your oars over there.:->emotionless
Tie these two boats together as well.:->emotionless
Now, make sure that's tied up nice and tight.:->fear
Right, listen to me, men. We have to go back.:->fear
I want to transfer all the women from this boat into that boat right now.:->fear
As quick as you can, please.:->fear
Let's create some space over there. Move forward and out.:->emotionless
It's getting quiet.:->emotionless
It's just going to take a couple of minutes to get the boats organized.:->Emotionless
I don't know about you ...:->Emotionless
but I intend to write a stronglyworded letter ...:->Emotionless
to the White Star Line about all this.:->Emotionless
I love you, Jack.:->happy
Don't you do that.:->fear
Don't you say your goodbyes.:->fear
Not yet. Do you understand me?:->fear
I'm so cold.:->sad
Listen, Rose ...:->fear
you're gonna get out of here.:->sad
You're gonna go on ...:->sad
and you're gonna make lots of babies.:->sad
And you're gonna watch them grow.:->sad
You're gonna die an old lady, warm in her bed.:->sad
Not here.:->sad
Not this night.:->sad
Not like this. Do you understand me?:->sad
I can't feel my body.:->fear
Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.:->happy
It brought me to you.:->happy
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.:->happy
I'm thankful.:->happy
You must ...:->happy
do me this honor.:->happy
You must promise me that you'll survive.:->happy
That you won't give up ...:->happy
no matter what happens.:->happy
No matter how hopeless.:->happy
Promise me now, Rose.:->happy
And never let go of that promise.:->happy
I promise.:->happy
Never let go.:->happy
I'll never let go, Jack.:->happy
I'll never let go.:->emotionless
Right ahead, sir.:->emotionless
Oars!:->sad
Do you see any moving?:->sad
No, sir. None moving, sir.:->sad
Check them.:->sad
Bring that oar up here.:->sad
Check them. Make sure.:->sad
These are dead, sir.:->sad
Now give way. Ahead easy.:->sad
Careful with your oars. Don't hit them.:->sad
Is there anyone alive out there?:->sad
Can anyone hear me?:->sad
Is there anyone alive out there?:->sad
We waited too long.:->sad
Keep checking them! Keep looking!:->sad
Is there anyone alive out there?:->sad
Can anyone hear me?:->sad
In my flying machine:->sad
And up she goes:->sad
Up she goes:->sad
Come, Josephine:->sad
In my flying machine:->sad
Jack?:->sad
There's a boat.:->sad
Jack?:->sad
There's a boat, Jack.:->sad
Come back.:->sad
Come back!:->sad
Hello!:->sad
Can anyone hear me?:->sad
There's nothing here, sir.:->sad
Come back.:->sad
I'll never let go. I promise.:->sad
Come about!:->sad
1,500 people went into the sea ...:->sad
when Titanic sank from under us.:->sad
There were 20 boats floating nearby ...:->Emotionless
and only one came back.:->Emotionless
One.:->Emotionless
6 were saved from the water ...:->Emotionless
myself included.:->Emotionless
6 out of 1,500.:->Emotionless
Afterward, the 700 people in the boats ...:->sad
had nothing to do but wait.:->sad
Wait to die, wait to live.:->sad
Wait for an absolution ...:->sad
that would never come.:->sad
Sir, I don't think you'll find any of your people down here.:->sad
It's all steerage.:->Emotionless
His hair is reddish brown, and a white beard.:->Emotionless
Isn't there another passenger list?  There's no other list.:->Emotionless
Perhaps he's on another ship.  We're doing all we can.:->Emotionless
That's the last time I ever saw him.:->Emotionless
He married, of course, and inherited his millions.:->Emotionless
But the crash of '29 hit his interests hard.:->Emotionless
And he put a pistol in his mouth that year.:->Emotionless
Or so I read.:->Emotionless
Can I take your name, please, love?:->happy
Dawson.:->happy
Rose Dawson.:->happy
Thank you.:->happy
We never found anything on Jack. There's no record of him at all.:->happy
No, there wouldn't be, would there?:->happy
And I've never spoken of him until now. Not to anyone.:->happy
Not even your grandfather.:->happy
A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets.:->happy
But now you know there was a man named Jack Dawson ...:->happy
and that he saved me ...:->happy
in every way that a person can be saved.:->happy
I don't even have a picture of him.:->happy
He exists now only in my memory.:->happy
Keldysh, Mir2 on our way to the surface.:->emotionless
I was saving this for when I found the diamond.:->emotionless
I'm sorry.:->sad
3 years.:->sad
I've thought of nothing except Titanic.:->sad
But I never got it.:->sad
I never let it in.:->sad
Every night in my dreams:->happy
I see you:->happy
I feel you:->happy
That is how I know you go on.:->happy
Far across the distance:->happy
And spaces between us:->happy
You have come to show you go on.:->happy
Near:->happy
Far:->happy
Wherever you are:->happy
I believe that the heart does go on.:->happy
Once more:->happy
you open the door:->happy
and you're here in my heart:->happy
and my heart will go on and on.:->happy
Love can touch just one time:->happy
and last for a lifetime:->happy
and never let go till we're gone.:->happy
Love was when I loved you:->happy
One true time I hold to:->happy
In my life we'll always go on.:->happy
Near:->happy
Far:->happy
Wherever you are:->happy
I believe that the heart does go on.:->happy
Once more:->happy
you open the door:->happy
and you're here in my heart:->happy
and my heart will go on and on.:->happy
You're here:->happy
There's nothing I fear:->happy
And I know that my heart will go on.:->happy
We'll stay:->happy
forever this way:->happy
You are safe in my heart:->happy
and my heart will go on and on:->happy
and love ...:->happy

What's the difference between men and women?:->emotionless
- Is this a joke? - No, serious.:->sad
I never met a woman who knew how to turn off a light.:->sad
They're born thinking in a switch, it only goes one way.:->sad
On.:->sad
*** blond *** lit room.:->sad
I mean every woman, every lady has a ***, I swear to God.:->sad
Come home,:->sad
house all lit up,:->sad
and my job, apparently because...:->sad
because my chromosomes happen to be different:->sad
cause I then gotta walk through that house,:->sad
turn off every single light this chick left on.:->sad
- Is that right? - Yeah, baby.:->sad
Alright, Reverend Shane's preaching to you now, boy.:->sad
The same chick, mind ya.:->sad
She'll bitch about global warming.:->sad
That's when Reverend Shane wants to:->sad
quote from the Guy Gospel and say "Um, darling?":->sad
"maybe you, and every other pair of boobs on this planet:->sad
just figured out that the light switch:->sad
see, goes both ways,:->sad
"maybe we wouldn't have so much global warming.":->sad
- You say that? - Yeah.:->sad
Anyway, uh...:->sad
Polite version...:->emotionless
Still man, that... that earns me this.:->emotionless
This look and loathing you would not believe.:->Emotionless
And that's when the exorcist voice pops out.:->sad
"You sound just like my damn father.:->sad
"Always, always yelling about the power bill,:->sad
"telling me to turn off the damn lights.":->sad
- What do you say to that? - You know what I wanna say.:->sad
I wanna say, "Bitch, you mean to tell me you've been hearing this your entire life:->sad
"and you are still too damn stupid to learn how to turn off a switch?:->sad
You know...:->emotionless
I don't actually say that, tho.:->emotionless
- That would be bad. - Yeah, go with the uh...:->emotionless
the polite version there...:->emotionless
- Very wise. - Yes, sir.:->emotionless
So how's it with Lori, man?:->emotionless
She's good. She's good at turning off lights.:->emotionless
Really good. I don't know why sometimes ***:->emotionless
Not what I meant.:->emotionless
- We didn't have a great night. - Look, man, I may have a...:->emotionless
fail to amuse with my sermon, but I did try.:->emotionless
The least you could do is speak.:->emotionless
That's what she always says: "Speak". "Speak".:->sad
You think I was the most closed mouth son of a bitch you'd ever hear to hear her tell it.:->sad
Do you express your thoughts?:->emotionless
You share your feelings and that kind of stuff?:->emotionless
The thing is...:->emotionless
lately whenever I try...:->emotionless
everything I say makes her impatient,:->sad
like she didn't want to hear it after all.:->emotionless
It's like she's...:->emotionless
pissed at me all the time, and I don't know why.:->sad
Look, man, that's just shit couples go through.:->sad
Nah, it's... It's a phase.:->emotionless
- Last thing she said this morning? - Mm?:->emotionless
Sometimes I wonder if you even care about us at all.:->emotionless
She said that in front of our kid.:->emotionless
Imagine going to school with that in your head.:->sad
Difference between men and women?:->emotionless
I would never say something that cruel to her.:->emotionless
Certainly not in front of Carl.:->emotionless
All available units, high speed pursuit in progress:->Emotionless

Hey, we'll get them on one of those video shows, you know,:->emotionless
like World's craziest police chases, what do you think?:->emotionless
What I think, Leon, is that you need to stay focused.:->emotionless
Make sure you got a round in the chamber and your safety off.:->emotionless
Would be kind of cool to get on one of them shows.:->emotionless
Holy shit.:->sad
- Gun, gun, gun. - Put it down!:->anger
Put the gun down!:->Emotionless

Shh, shh, stay with me, you hear me?:->anger
Shh, shh, ok?:->anger

Hey, bud...:->fear
We're still here.:->fear
We're still hanging in.:->emotionless
Look, I'm sorry, man.:->fear
I'm mean watching the same crap every time I come in here.:->sad
Everybody pitched in on these. They uh...:->sad
They wanted me to bring them down, they send their love and they just...:->anger
They hope you come back real soon.:->sad
Linda and Diane from dispatch, they picked these out.:->emotionless
You probably could tell, hmm?:->emotionless
I'll just set this on your side table, ok?:->emotionless
That vase has something special.:->Emotionless
Fess up. Did you steal it from your Grandma Gene's house.:->happy
I hope you left her that spoon collection.:->emotionless
Shane?:->emotionless
Shane, you in the john?:->emotionless

Wake, wake up!:->Emotionless

Carl?:->happy
I found you...:->happy
Daddy, I got this sumbitch. I'm gonna smack him dead.:->Emotionless
He say something? I thought I heard him say something.:->sad
- He called me Carl. - Son, you know they don't talk.:->emotionless
Hey, mister!:->emotionless
What's that bandage for?:->Emotionless
- What? - What kind of wound?:->sad
You answer me, damn you!:->sad
What's your wound?:->sad
You tell me!:->sad
Or I will kill you.:->Emotionless
Got that bandage changed out. It was pretty rank.:->emotionless
What was? The wound?:->emotionless
- Gun shot. - Gun shot?:->emotionless
What else? Anything?:->emotionless
Gun shot ain't enough?:->sad
Look, I ask and you answer,:->sad
It's common courtesy, right?:->sad
Did you get bit?:->Emotionless
- Bit? - Bit. Chewed.:->sad
Maybe scratch? Anything like that.:->sad
No, I got shot.:->emotionless
- Just shot? - As far as I know.:->emotionless
Hey...:->sad
Just let me...:->sad
Feels cooler now.:->emotionless
Fever would have killed you by now.:->emotionless
- I don't think I have one. - Be hard to miss.:->Emotionless
Take a moment, eh?:->emotionless
Look how sharp it is.:->Emotionless
You try anything...:->Emotionless
I will kill you with it, and don't you think I won't.:->Emotionless
Come on up when you're able.:->emotionless
Come on.:->Emotionless
This place...:->emotionless
It's Fred and Cindy Drake's.:->emotionless
Never met them.:->fear
I've been here. This is their place:->emotionless
It was empty when we got here.:->emotionless
Don't do that.:->sad
They'll see the light.:->anger
There's more of them out there than usual.:->anger
I never should have fired that gun today.:->anger
The sound draws them, now they're all over the street.:->emotionless
Stupid... using a gun...:->sad
It all happened so fast...:->Emotionless
- I didn't think. - You shot that man today.:->Emotionless
Man?:->Emotionless
- No man... - What the hell was that out of your mouth just now?:->sad
- It wasn't a man. - You shot him.:->sad
In this street, out front, a man.:->sad
For him, you need glasses, that was a walker.:->anger
Come on.:->Emotionless
Sit down, before you fall down.:->emotionless
Here. Eat.:->emotionless
Daddy...:->emotionless
Blessing...:->happy
Yeah.:->emotionless
Father, we thank thee for this food...:->happy
Thy blessings...:->happy
We ask you to watch over us in these crazy days.:->happy
- Amen. - Amen.:->happy
Hey, mister, do you even know what is going on?:->sad
I woke up today.:->Emotionless
In a hospital.:->emotionless
Came home, that's all I know.:->emotionless
- But you know about the dead people, right? - Yeah, I saw a lot of that.:->emotionless
Out on the loading dock, hauling trucks.:->emotionless
No...:->emotionless
Not the one's they put down...:->emotionless
The one's they didn't. The walkers.:->emotionless
Like the one I shot today.:->emotionless
Cause he would have ripped into you.:->anger
Try to eat you, take him some flesh at least.:->anger
But I guess if this is the first you're hearing,:->Emotionless
I know how it must sound...:->Emotionless
- They're out there now, in the street? - Yeah.:->anger
They're even more active after dark sometimes.:->anger
Maybe it's the cool air or...:->anger
Hell, maybe it's just me firing up that gun today.:->anger
But we'll be fine long as we stay quiet.:->happy
Probably wander off by morning.:->happy
Well, listen...:->emotionless
One thing I do know...:->emotionless
Don't you get bit!:->sad
We saw your bandage and that's why we were afraid of.:->anger
Bites kill you.:->anger
The fever... burns you out.:->anger
But then after a while...:->anger
You come back.:->anger
Seen it happen...:->anger
Come on...:->anger
Carl...:->emotionless
He your son?:->emotionless
William..:->emotionless
He said his name today...:->emotionless
He's a little younger...:->emotionless
than your boy.:->emotionless
And he's with his mother?:->emotionless
I hope so.:->emotionless
- Dad? - Yeah?:->emotionless
Did you ask him?:->emotionless
Your gun shot...:->emotionless
We got a little bet going. My boy say you're a...:->Emotionless
bank robber...:->Emotionless
Yeah...:->Emotionless
That's me. Deadly as Dillinger. Kapow.:->happy
Sheriff's deputy.:->emotionless
Aha.:->Emotionless
Hey, it's ok, daddy's here.:->happy
It's nothing.:->emotionless
One of them must've bumped a car...:->emotionless
- You sure? - Happened once before.:->Emotionless
Went off a few minutes.:->emotionless
Get the light, Dwayne.:->emotionless
It's the blue one, down the street.:->emotionless
Same one as last time.:->emotionless
I think we're ok.:->emotionless
That noise...:->sad
Will it bring more of them?:->anger
Nothing to do about it now.:->emotionless
Just have to wait 'em out till morning.:->emotionless
She's here.:->fear
Don't look. Get away from the windows.:->fear
I said go! Come on!:->fear
Come on, quiet.:->fear
Shh, shh...:->fear
It's ok, here. Cry into the pillow.:->fear
Can you remember?:->fear
Shh...:->fear
She, uh...:->fear
She died in the other room, on that bed...:->fear
Nothin' I can do about it here...:->fear
That fever, man...:->fear
Her skin gave off heat like a furnace...:->fear
Should have put her down, I should have put her down, I know that, but...:->fear
You know what...:->fear
I just didn't have it in me...:->fear
She's the mother of my child.:->fear
- You sure? - They're dead.:->fear
They have to ask, at least one more time.:->fear
They're dead. Except for something in the brain.:->fear
That's why it's gotta be the head.:->fear
You alright?:->fear
Need a moment?:->fear
They're alive.:->fear
My wife and son.:->fear
At least they were when they left.:->fear
How can you know?:->Emotionless
- By the look of this place... - I found empty drawers in the bedroom.:->emotionless
They packed some clothes. Not a lot.:->emotionless
But enough to travel.:->emotionless
You know anybody could've broken in here and stolen clothes, right?:->Emotionless
You see the framed photos on the walls?:->Emotionless
Neither do I. Some random thief took those too, you think?:->emotionless
My photo albums, family pictures, all gone.:->emotionless
Photo albums...:->emotionless
My wife...:->Emotionless
Same thing...:->emotionless
Here I am, packing survival gear, she's grabbing photo albums....:->Emotionless
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.:->Emotionless
That's right.:->emotionless
- Why there? - Refugee settle.:->Emotionless
Huge, when they said it, before the broadcast stopped.:->emotionless
Military protection, food, shelter...:->emotionless
They told people to go there.:->emotionless
Said to be safest.:->emotionless
Plus they got that disease place.:->emotionless
Center for Disease Control.:->emotionless
Said they were working on how to solve this thing.:->emotionless
Gas and light have been down for maybe a month.:->emotionless
Station got its own propane system.:->emotionless
Pilot's still on.:->emotionless
Oh, my Lord.:->Emotionless
Hot water!:->Emotionless
- Whoo! - That feels good, right?:->happy
Dwayne...:->happy
Dress in room back there.:->happy
What you say, Dwayne?:->emotionless
Thank you.:->happy
Mhm.:->happy
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.:->happy
Safer anyway. People...:->happy
That's where we were heading.:->happy
Things got crazy. Man, you won't believe.:->happy
The panic...:->fear
Streets won't fit to be on, and then we'll...:->emotionless
My wife...:->anger
couldn't travel. no, not with our herd,:->Emotionless
so we had to find a place to lay low.:->emotionless
And then, after she died...:->fear
We just stayed hunkered down.:->emotionless
I guess we just froze in place.:->fear
Plan to move on?:->fear
Haven't worked up to it yet. (*):->emotionless
A lot of it's gone missing.:->emotionless
Dad, can I learn to shoot?:->emotionless
I'm old enough.:->emotionless
Hell yes you're going to learn.:->sad
We gotta do it carefully, teach you to respect the weapon.:->emotionless
That's right. It's not a toy.:->fear
You pull the trigger, you have to mean it. Always remember that, Dwayne.:->anger
Yes, sir.:->sad
Here.:->emotionless
Go on.:->emotionless
Take that one.:->emotionless
Nothing fancy.:->emotionless
Scope's accurate.:->emotionless
Conserve your ammo. Goes faster than you think. Especially at target practice.:->emotionless
Dwayne.:->emotionless
- Yeah? - Take this to the car.:->emotionless
You sure you won't come along?:->emotionless
A few more days...:->emotionless
By the end, Dwayne will know how to shoot and I won't be so rusty.:->emotionless
You got one better.:->happy
I'll turn mine on, a few minutes every day at dawn.:->emotionless
You get up there, that's how you find me.:->emotionless
- You think they're here? - Can't afford not to.:->emotionless
- Not anymore. - Look, just one thing.:->emotionless
They may not seem like much one at a time...:->emotionless
but in a group all round up and hungry...:->anger
- They you watch your ass. - You too.:->anger
You a good man, Rick.:->happy
I hope you find your wife and son.:->happy
Be seeing you, Dwayne.:->happy
- Take care of your old man. - Yes, sir.:->emotionless
Leon Bessi?:->emotionless
Didn't think much of him.:->sad
Careless and dumb, but...:->sad
can't leave him like this.:->emotionless
You know, if they hear the shot..?:->anger
- Let's not be here when they show up. - Let's go, son.:->anger
Come on.:->emotionless
Read your comic books a while.:->emotionless
Daddy'll be upstairs.:->emotionless
- Daddy? - It's alright, Dwayne.:->emotionless
You stay there, son. Don't come up here.:->emotionless
Come on, baby.:->Emotionless
